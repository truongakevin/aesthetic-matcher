# hello everyone!Â  I'm working on a university project that uses AI to classify aesthetic styles. It's going to be an app or website that allows you to take or upload a picture that will then use an AI model to classify the aesthetic. I am currently working on building a dataset of labeled pictures by aesthetic to train the model, so if anyone has any websites or resources where I might be able to find aesthetics and images that match them that would be helpful. right now im working on scraping all the pictures from the aesthetics wiki website but any other resources would be much appreciated!
# hey everyone! ive been working on a website that matches images to aesthetics so you can upload an image and it will tell you what aesthetic it is. it uses a finetuned machine learning model trained on all images from the aesthetics wiki. i finally got it to a working state so i wanted to share it with yall! its still a work in progress so im open to suggestions and it is running on my local machine so it might be a bit slow and possibly buggy but the website is kevinatruong.com/aesthetic-matcher/
