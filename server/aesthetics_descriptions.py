aesthetics_descriptions = [('2 Tone', "2 Tone is a genre of music that combines Ska (brought over by waves of Jamaican immigrants to the UK) with certain elements of Punk and New Wave. Despite the contradicting styles, 2 Tone blends these genres, making for a faster rendition of the ska genre. Many 2 Tone songs are in fact covers of Jamaican songs, such as 'A Message to You, Rudy', 'Monkey Man', and 'Time Hard'. The name comes from the record label of the same name, which was founded by Jerry Dammers, keyboardist of The Specials. Between its music and visuals, 2 Tone became a significant subculture in the British alternative music scene. Fans of 2 Tone are often referred to as Rude Boys (or rudeboy, rudie, rudi, and rudy). Rude Boy came from a slang term that originated from 1960s Jamaican street culture. Coming along at a time of great upheaval in Thatcher-era Britain, 2 Tone providing youth with an outlet for their discontent and an escape through dancing. Also a key aspect of both the 2 Tone label, music, and the bands themselves was promoting equality and denouncing racism. The checkerboard motif symbolizes a union between the races, and many 2 Tone bands had both black and white members. "), ('2000s Virtual Singer', '2000s Virtual Singer is an aesthetic and character trope based around fictional mascots that many companies used and were popular approximately from 2005 to the mid 2010s. These corporate mascots were often portrayed dancing and/or singing for an audience in a specific space, and generally they were anthropomorphized animals or objects, although a few might be humans. Some music videos involving 2000s Virtual Singers were also marketed as ringtone commercials that one could buy for their mobile phones, specifically due to the technological limitations of the time. Some iconic child-oriented examples of this aesthetic include Gummibär or Psycho Teddy, both created by the company Jamba!, while other more juvenile examples may include Hatsune Miku and the VOCALOID boom during the late 2000s. Since 2000s Virtual Singers were primarily popularized through TV ringtone commercials and holiday jingles, the aesthetic possibly started to fall out of style during the mid-2010s, since selling ringtones or wallpapers was no longer fashionable or convenient and they became more widely avaiable for free to the public. Some of the last examples of popular 2000s Virtual Singer commercials may include Gummy Style by Gummibär. It was a parody of the song Oppa Gangnam Style by PSY, which was one of the most popular songs at the time. '), ('2010s Internet', '2010s Internet was an era of Internet culture that took place in the 2000s and early 2010s, mainly 2007 to 2014. It influenced several internet aesthetics as we know them today. The aesthetic itself contains elements that are nostalgic to a great part of the people who grew up with them, such as internet memes, media, videos, characters, flash games and music. Several aesthetics like Scene, Frutiger Aero, Old Web, MLG, Old Meme, Internet Awesomesauce and many more were prominent during this phase. This also includes taking a liking to things that were popular during this time, such as My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic (the fourth generation of the My Little Pony franchise) and Creepypasta. '), ('2014 Girly', '2014 Girly Tumblr is an aesthetic seen in 2014 Tumblr. It centers itself around visuals that girly Tumblr bloggers found popular at the time. It embraces girly traits and colors, such as pale pink, white and mint, as well as brands, celebrities, room decor trends, foods, etc. that would be aspirational and overtly feminine. '), ('2014 Tumblr', '2014 Tumblr is one of the biggest influences to the contemporary aesthetics movement. As an image-aggregating site, it allowed people to curate personal reblogs easily. The ability to create a customized theme for the blog also enhanced the aesthetic value of the website. This article focuses on 2014 (more broadly 2011–2018) because this was the era before -core suffixes existed, Tumblr was at its greatest cultural relevancy, and the aesthetic trend was at its infancy. Around 2020, many 2014 Tumblr aesthetics came back into style(often with slightly new looks due to different fashion trends), such as Morute, Pink Parisian(which evolved into Pink Princess), Delicate Sweet(which evolved into Gloomy Coquette) and Pastel Goth(which became popular among the E-Kid/E-Girl aesthetics). Nymphet regained popularity and along with Delicate Sweet and Pink Parisian formed the modern interpretation of Coquette aka Dollette. '), ('2020s E-Kid', '2020s E-Kid, or 2020 Alt, is an early 2020s fashion style that originally became popular on TikTok and later spread to other social media platforms such as Pinterest. Similar to E-Girl and E-Boy, the term refers to chronically online young teens who participate in TikTok trends and wear a newer iteration of alternative fashion. Unlike E-Girl, however, there is no sexual connotation to the aesthetic due to the fact that those participating are usually minors. It also tends to be more gender neutral. '), ('2K1', '2K1, also called Dirty Flirty Style, is an aesthetic that was prevalent from roughly 2001 to 2004. This style bridged the gap between the Y2K Futurism and McBling eras, being a cross between the two styles. Raunchy "big red text" comedies, throwback jerseys, Minivan Rock, and Neptunes-type hip-hop production all surged at this time while Teen Pop was slowly being phased away. The 2K1 term was coined by designer Steves Peeps in 2022. After 2K1 ended, it was succeeded by the 2K5 era. '), ('2K5', "2K5 is a television and fashion aesthetic that was prevalent from roughly 2004 to mid 2006. It acts as the missing link between McBling and 2K7 aesthetics. As the United States' economy recovered from the recession of the early 2000s, some of the era's fashion began to reflect warmer tones. The first indications of the aesthetics can be found in the emerging Bohemian trend and The WB Crush aesthetic. The term was coined by designer Steves Peeps in 2023. "), ('2K7', '2K7, also known as the Dark and Digital Era, is a music video aesthetic that was popular from 2006 to 2008. This futuristic video style bridged the gap between the McBling and Electropop 08 eras. This look was widespread in music videos, television shows, and films. Dark clothes and chilly blue colors are common features of this aesthetic. Producer Timbaland is often associated with this era. The term was coined by designer Steves Peeps in 2022. '), ('50s Suburbia', '50s Suburbia is an aesthetic that describes the culture of the American middle class in the 1950s. Due to a population boom following World War II, new neighborhoods were built in the areas surrounding large cities. These communities were known as suburbs, thus the term suburbia. The most famous example is Levittown, in New York state, which was the prototype for mass produced, mass-scale housing. The government led push for a return to normalcy (i.e., traditional gender roles) following World War II, created an idealized image of the American family and the United States itself. The ideal suburban neighborhood was a friendly community, where everyone looked and thought exactly the same way, and everyone was happy. This image was reflected in advertising, books, and television shows. 50s Suburbia imagery was used in the horror genre as early as 1956 (in Invasion of the Body Snatchers) to indicate the uncanny or surreal. Today, the intensely gendered and socially regimented lives of the middle class of the time are a source of fear to an audience that lives in a post-second wave feminist world. See Suburban Gothic for more details. '), ('8-Bit', '8-Bit is the aesthetic associated with early home gaming and arcade games, similar to early DOS and other early operating systems. It grew out of graphic limitations of games that ran on hardware with 8-bit CPUs like Sega Master System, NES, Game Boy, Atari, and Virtual Pets. It is also associated with later games that didn\'t necessarily run on 8-bit hardware but still had limited graphics. It is characterized by blocky, sometimes extremely simplified pixel art and absence of dithering. Art, especially animated sprites, often lacks any outline or shading. Another common design element is text with a dropshadow to add legibility or visual appeal. Because of the low resolution (the consoles in particular were limited to 256-pixel resolution) of these systems relative to the display, the pixels were extremely large, particularly on consumer televisions which could easily be twice the size of a typical CRT display. While 8-bit is generally understood to correspond primarily with the Sega Master System and NES-based console games, this page includes earlier and similar-era media on other platforms like arcades and computers. Due to its nostalgia factor and the low cost of extremely simple graphics for amateur game design, the aesthetic has never entirely gone out of fashion. However, most "retro 8-bit" games tend to harken back to the 16-bit era rather than true 8-bit.'), ('80 Thousand', '80 Thousand is an aesthetic that was prominent in the 2000s with media set in or about the 1980s. It contains several visual and fashion motifs from that era as a result of the 20-year nostalgia cycle prominent with many aesthetics, such as Synthwave and Vaporwave. This style was popular with television shows, music, and fashion. The 80 Thousand aesthetic is the first wave of 80s nostalgia, primarily focused on media from the early-to-mid-1980s. The aesthetic was coined by Steve Peeps in 2023. '), ('80s Heartthrob', "80s Heartthrob aesthetic is a perfect blend of classic style and 1980s-specific elements that make it stand out from the rest. The fashion style of this aesthetic is characterized by sleek, fitted clothing, bold patterns, and statement accessories that are both edgy and classic. Think of bomber jackets, leather jackets, denim jackets, and colorful t-shirts with graphic prints. Don't forget the iconic aviator sunglasses, leather gloves, and chunky bracelets that complete the look. The aesthetic is not just about fashion, it's also about capturing the mood and atmosphere of the 80s. The music, movies, and overall vibe of the era are all part of this aesthetic. "), ('90s Cool', '90s Cool (also known as The Matrix Effect or Bullet Time), was an aesthetic that started in the mid-1990s and emphasized martial arts-style fight choreography mixed with computer generated (CGI) effects, this aesthetic was loosely inspired by the growing rise of anime in the west, and had a very rigid use of Y2K Futurism and Cyberpunk aesthetics. 90s Cool became more prominent after the success of The Matrix movies. During The Matrix hype around 1999/2000, studios were quick to release the next Matrix by taking influence from the various styles that were done in the iconic film from 1999. The aesthetic was mostly known for its use of Bullet Time (a slow motion camera tracking shot) and its costumes which included black leather trench coats, combat boots, Oakley glasses, bullet proof vests, latex catsuits and dark formal wear. '), ('Abstract Tech', 'Abstract Tech consists of design motifs, such as concentric arcs, hexagons, or circuit patterns, that are intended to represent the abstract concept of “technology,” or evoke a sense of something being futuristic or technologically advanced. This aesthetic can primarily be found in science fiction media of the Digital Age, such as user interfaces (holographic touchscreens and heads-up displays), depictions of cyberspace, and other technological imagery. Examples include interfaces from Minority Report (2002) and Iron Man (2008), or the video game TRON 2.0 (2003) and the film TRON: Legacy (2010), as well as stock images and backgrounds/wallpapers related to keywords like "technology," "high-tech," "digital," or "cyber." '), ('Acid Design', 'Acid Design is a graphic design aesthetic heavily associated with Rave culture, particularly influenced by Acid House and New Beat music. This style is primarily present in EDM cover arts, flyers, music clubs, and other trendy brands, among other scenes. The style of this aesthetic is characterized by its dystopian style and trippy imagery, including motifs like Psychedelic art, distorted patterns and typefaces, smiley faces, wireframe objects, world maps and globes, technology and geometric shapes. '), ('Acid Pixie', 'Acid Pixie molds together elements of Biopunk, Voidpunk, and specific elements of Nu-Goth and Indie. '), ('Acidwave', 'Acidwave is centered around visuals inspired by depictions of hallucinations caused by hallucinogenic drugs, especially lysergic acid diethylamide, colloquially known as LSD or acid, from which the aesthetic derives its name. It started as a subgenre of House music that was popular in raves (which could draw some comparisons to Raver culture) but has evolved into a full blown aesthetic in its own right. '), ('Adventurecore', 'Adventurecore involves adventure, the great unknown, and exploration. The main theme and philosophy are encouraging curiosity and having a yearning to see it all. It often focuses on the outdoors and wild landscapes. The original creator, Tumblr user advenchurre, has stated "It\'s about the idea of navigating the world like you\'re a protag about to set off on a big cross-country journey. Even if you live in the suburbs".'), ('Adventure Pulp', 'Pulp is a literary and artistic genre of the early 20th century that encompasses many subgenres of literature, especially horror, detective and science fiction. However the "adventure" subgenre also had a significant impact, drawing inspiration from the "Lost World" fiction and non-fiction explorer literature. The core of this aesthetic is perhaps the Indiana Jones franchise, which, beginning in early \'80s, started as a tribute to the existing genre; the character of Indiana Jones was created as a pastiche of such heroes and historical figures, but in turn also redefined, revitalised and popularised the aesthetic in modern times, and spawned other tributes and ripoffs. The roots of the aesthetic are older and can be traced to the western colonialism, and represents a Victorian\'s romanticised perception of the Exotic. In a historical context, protagonists of the tradition were hardened western explorers, archeologists, hunters, officials, and even spies, who served and operated in Africa, "the Orient" (Asia and the Middle East), and the Amazon to contact other cultures and even primitive tribes. Those historical personalities had multidisciplinary background in many languages, cultures, history, engineering, wildlife, and nature. The limited knowledge and understanding of history and these undiscovered regions- and the high amount of superstition and pseudoscience prevailing in the era- gave to these stories a larger-than-life aura of mystery. Pseudohistorical and supernatural elements are common in fiction; even more recent works portray a highly fictionalised version of real-life locations and figures. Egyptian mysticism, curses, shamanism, out-of-place objects, ancient aliens, and extraterrestrial or Atlantean technology, are frequent tropes. '), ('Aeropittura', 'Aeropittura, also called Aeropainting in English, was an art movement during the second generation of Italian Futurism, roughly lasting from 1929 to the late 1940s. This movement emerged during the aftermath of World War I, reflecting the Futurists fascination with aviation and the transformative power of modern technology; which became one of the most important and newest topics in post-war Italian art. The artists of the Aeropittura art movement sought to create an aesthetic that featured the most interesting elements of the new technologies of the time, particularly focusing on aeroplanes. Aeropittura art usually experimented with key elements like dynamism, speed and the portrayal of flight in their art; trying to make their static paintings look like they\'re moving. So, Aeropittura is often portrayed from the "point of view of a bird", creating a sense of vertigo. Aeropittura became officially an art movement in its own right when a group of eight Italian artists published the Perspectives of Flight in 1929, which was the manifesto of the Aeropittura art movement and its general ideas. That group of artists included; Benedetta Cappa, Fortunato Depero, Gerardo Dottori, Fillìa, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Enrico Prampolini, Mino Somenzi and Tato. The term Aeropittura is a combination of the Italian words aero (from aeroplano; airplane) and pittura (painting). '), ('Aestheticism', 'Aestheticism (or the Aesthetic Movement) was an art movement in the late 19th century which valued the appearance of literature, music and the arts over their functions. According to Aestheticism, art should be produced to be beautiful, rather than to teach a lesson, create a parallel, or perform another didactic purpose, a sentiment best illustrated by the slogan "art for art\'s sake." Aestheticism originated in 1860s England with a radical group of artists and designers, including William Morris and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. It flourished in the 1870s and 1880s, gaining prominence and the support of notable writers such as Walter Pater and Oscar Wilde. Aestheticism challenged the values of mainstream Victorian culture, as many Victorians believed that literature and art fulfilled important ethical roles. Writing in The Guardian, Fiona McCarthy states that "the aesthetic movement stood in stark and sometimes shocking contrast to the crass materialism of Britain in the 19th century." Aestheticism was named by the critic Walter Hamilton in The Aesthetic Movement in England in 1882. By the 1890s, decadence, a term with origins in common with aestheticism, was in use across Europe. '), ('Aetherpunk', "Aetherpunk or Arcanepunk is probably one of the most diverse punk genres. High fantasy magic creates technology more befitting of a sci-fi world, from magical sky-ships to magical powered weapons. Architecture has guiled gold, enchanted lighting, stained glass art, and ancient pagan imagery; Think Asgard from the Marvel Franchise. But, most importantly, it is a rather new genre that is similar to Solarpunk as the 'Punk' doesn't come from its dystopian social exploration nature but instead its utopian social elevation nature that looks to help people who are suffering and bring a world that is inherently good. Utopian fiction can still have negative themes, such as Adventure Time's Lich, which acts as the antagonist and is usually in the form of a Dark Lord like Lord of the Rings. "), ('Afrofuturism', "Afrofuturism is an aesthetic centered around an Afrocentric view of the future (it shares some similarity to Solarpunk [which is something of a misnomer itself since Solarpunk is a less dystopian worldview compared to Cyberpunk]) and buys into the philosophy that the future is black. Afrofuturism is one of the rare aesthetics that can encompass the visual medium, fashion, the written word, and music, and tackles themes such as feminism, alienation from your people, the grotesque, water symbolism, and reclamation of one's identity through their roots. Afrofuturist thought is probably what inspired the initial push for the Art Hoe movement. Probably the most popular example of Afrofuturism in popular culture right now is Black Panther. "), ('Afropunk', 'Afropunk (sometimes spelled Afro-Punk or AfroPunk) refers to the participation of African Americans and other Black people in punk and alternative subcultures, especially in the United States. '), ('Afro-Victorian', '"We wanted to reflect that diversity with our costume decisions. We aimed for this fusion of 19th-century silhouettes with African culture....." He refers to the look as “Afro-Victorian,” adding: “In the world of fantastical, the story worked on such a completing human level that we really wanted to reach out to audiences and offer them something very appealing and modern.”- Michael Wilkinson, Women\'s Wear Daily, November 13, 2020'), ('After Hours', 'After Hours is an aesthetic inspired by the forlorn atmosphere of empty or seemingly abandoned places that are usually bustling with people. After Hours isn’t defined in terms of a specific artstyle or media, but instead by the imagery of various abandoned places such as empty streets, schools, and parks. However, the aesthetic is not limited to physical settings either; online settings such as abandoned blogs, empty game servers, and inactive websites can also elicit similar feelings. The concept is built on the contrast between the memories or expectations associated with a place and the current reality of it being abandoned or devoid of human presence. These feelings, which have collectively been coined as kenopsia, include a mix of nostalgia, melancholy, and a sense of surrealism. The emptiness of the abandoned space and the remains of its former vitality can create a powerful emotional response. For some, it might cause them to reflect on the passage of time, the transience of life, or the impermanence of human activities. The always-present tranquility of After Hours distinguishes it from the adjacent aesthetic of Liminal Space, which is intentionally designed to be unsettling and foreboding.Several people who identify with this aesthetic like to explore such places, while others - such as graveyard shift workers - have no option but to be active during night. These night-crawlers love silence and quiet settings. Being away from everyone and everything is comforting to them. The aesthetic is commonly seen in Post-Apocalyptic media to convey the effects of the world becoming empty. '), ('Agropeople', 'Agrocore is a Brazilian term that refers to people working in the agribusiness, and is not always used in a positive way. The term itself is constantly used in songs, often those consumed by so-called agrogirls/agroboys. Its origin is usually credited to the mixture of Brazilian country culture and Brazilian 2000s urban culture. The aesthetic became popular during the rise of the Sertanejo and Forró genres, especially amongst university students due to many people born in the countryside moving to urban areas for education and work opportunities. These people were usually the sons and daughters of well-heeled property owners; they didn\'t want to let go of their traditions, yet have the dream and money to adapt to the "big city". Eventually, the aesthetic spread back to the actual farm fields, probably due to those people coming back home. '), ('Ah Beng', 'An Ah Beng (阿明) or Ah Lian (阿莲) are Chinese-language pejorative terms applied to describe an antisocial lower-class youth in Singapore who displays common characteristics such as having dyed hair, wearing loud fashion, playing loud music in public and being less educated. '), ('Alien', 'Alien is an aesthetic inspired by extraterrestrial and otherworldly life forms, particularly in relating with these creatures, wanting to be these creatures, and not feeling in tune with humanity. It has themes of isolation, a lack of belonging, and rebelling against social norms, and elements of it can be found in fashion, music, video games, and sci-fi movies. '), ('Alternative', 'Alternative, also abbreviated as Alt, is an umbrella term that can describe anything that sits outside of the mainstream. Colloquially it refers to dark western styles such as Punk, Grunge, Emo, etc though the true meaning includes a wide range of darker and lighter styles from all cultures. Sometimes, if a subculture is particularly popular (rock is an example of this), alternative rock would be its own sub-genre outside of \'mainstream\' rock. It is important to note that most aesthetics could fall under the alternative label nowadays. Additionally, the line between alternative and mainstream is becoming very blurred due to the power of the internet in promoting "underground" artists. Alternative originated as a genre of music, described by Merriam-Webster as "music that is produced by performers who are outside the musical mainstream, that is typically regarded as more eclectic, original, or challenging than most popular music (such as conventional rock, pop, or country), and that is often distributed by independent record labels." Due to this, in music terms, alternative and indie (independent) have similar connotations, indie meaning not associated with a mainstream record label. It is important to note that "indie" is not a specific sound, it better describes the way the sound is released. Alternative rock is the most popular genre of alternative music, and is what most people think of when alternative is mentioned. Alternative rock gained most of its popularity from 1991 to 1997 in the wake of Nirvana\'s "Smells Like Teen Spirit", as described in this article. The title "alternative" has developed to often be used as a label for clothing that is outside current fashion trends. The label "alt" is also being used a lot on TikTok to describe fashion that doesn\'t fit into other categories. '), ('Amateur Photography', 'Amateur Photography is an aesthetic relevant around 2000-2010, which depicts images taken from weird angles, or of seemingly random objects or scenes. Since the aesthetic arose in 2000-2010, the images were taken in sub-par quality, leaving your mind to fill in the details. '), ('Americana', 'Americana is a loosely-defined aesthetic which consists of music, artifacts, scenery, folklore, and material culture which are seen as distinctly or especially "American" (i.e., of or relating to what is now the United States and its inhabitants). There is considerable disagreement over what counts as "American" because vast differences exist between different regions and subcultures within American society. For example, most people would put Jazz or Hip-Hop aesthetics in separate categories from Americana, despite both genres being uniquely American in their origins, promulgation, and current praxis. Similarly, Juggalos and the Amish do not fall under the "Americana" umbrella, though Yeehaw might. Much of the aesthetic is characterized by nostalgia for an idealized past, often seen as "more wholesome" than modern American culture and style. The aesthetic is often commercialized: restaurant chains such as Red Robin and Applebee\'s decorate their interior walls with a collection of mid-20th century artifacts and signage which is affectionately known as "Americana clutter". '), ('American Gothic', 'American Gothic is a subgenre of the Gothic, or gothic horror, a type of fiction that arose in conjunction with the Romantic literary movement. American Gothic as a genre is defined by real-life American horrors and bloodshed, allegorization of personal, generational, and social traumas, and a focus on the mental state, often a descent into madness. Aesthetically, it invokes isolation, Christianity (mostly Protestant), and the lush American landscape. Southern, Appalachian, New England, and Midwest Gothic are subtypes of American Gothic. '), ('American Pioneers', 'American Pioneers refers to the settlers that colonized the western portion what is now known as the United States of America in the 19th century. For the most part these people were white, and either Americans from the East Coast or European immigrants. (After the American Civil War, a significant population of Black pioneers known as the Exodusters existed but their motivations and experiences were somewhat different from white pioneers. They were not part of the image of the American Pioneer that existed in the 19th Century and little attention is given to them in both historical fiction and American History lessons.) Pioneers were motivated by Manifest Destiny, a concept within American culture that claims that God has ordered the American people to make the nation occupied from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Violence towards Native Americans was considered a necessary evil in the pursuit of this goal. The visual tropes associated with pioneer life are distinctive and familiar to Americans. They are inspired by the travel equipment and landscape along the routes west. Much of the allure of this is the ruggedness and self-sufficiency of the people in contrast to the wild, untamed nature of their surroundings. The hardship that the people who traveled along the Oregon Trail faced is often a point of fascination and shock value. The Donner Party, a group of families that resorted to cannibalism in the wintertime, has been used as a point of horror and portrayal of the extremes that humans can go to when they are desperate. '), ('American Thanksgiving', "American Thanksgiving refers to the American holiday that takes place every fourth Thursday of November. This holiday is incredibly noteworthy in American culture, and involves a large, home-cooked feast of foods traditionally associated with Thanksgiving eaten with relatives and friends. Other traditions came about, such as watching football, different parades (most notably the Macy's parade in New York City), and charity work. Because of the highly established traditions, Thanksgiving has a certain set of expected visuals, including decorations put out by retailers, expected foods to eat, and associations with Autumn. "), ('Analog Horror', 'Analog Horror (or Analogue Horror) is the older counterpart of Digital Horror and a subgenre of Found Footage, which incorporates old "analog" styled media such as TV Broadcasts, VHS Tapes, and EAS while including horror elements that evoke feelings of dread, fear, and uncanniness. '), ('Ancient Egypt', "Ancient Egypt was a historical civilization in Northern Africa that lasted from 3150 BC to 30 BC. The boundaries of the period are set by the beginning of the dynastic monarchs (pharaohs) who ruled Egypt and Rome's conquest of Egypt. The aesthetics of Ancient Egypt have influenced art and design for thousands of years. In recent centuries it was most prominent during the Victorian Era through the Egyptian Revival style in design and architecture, due to early archeology in Egypt. In the 1920s, after Howard Carter and his team opened the tomb of King Tutankhamun (King Tut), Egyptian art influenced the Art Deco movement, causing an 'Egyptomania'. "), ('Ancient Y2K', ' Historic Y2K (not to be confused with FantasY2K) is a sub-aesthetic of Y2K and Y2K Futurism that is characterized by an attempt to create or recreate medieval or ancient aesthetics, locations, or settings with the technology of the 1990s and 2000s. This aesthetic is often seen in 3D renders, video games, and dungeon synth music. Visuals of this aesthetic are usually low poly and low resolution. This aesthetic died out in the early 2010s when 3D graphics were getting better at generating more realistic environments. This aesthetic usually depicts settings in Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. The reason dungeon synth is considered to be part of this aesthetic is because it uses clearly artificial sounds with medieval sounding chords and scales to create an "artificial" medieval sound. '), ('Androgynous', 'Androgyny is the combination of "masculine" and "feminine" characteristics, making them into an ambiguous form. Androgyny in terms of clothing style may be expressed without regard to biological sex, gender identity, gender expression, or sexual identity. '), ('Angelcore', 'Angelcore is a contemporary aesthetic inspired by imagery and depictions of angels, and is adjacent to devilcore. It is very similar in vibe with the Rococo style of the 18th century. Some of the old paintings with cherubs you find on Pinterest are Rococo. The aesthetic is designed to emulate the same unearthly beauty that the European stereotype of angels are described and depicted with, though it can also include non-European angel aesthetics. This can be done with modern or older presentation methods. It’s also worth noting that much of the angel mythology and imagery comes from multiple belief systems (from Greek paganism, to Judaism, to New Age, to the aforementioned Christianity). So there are no specific religious connections or connotations involved in an angelic aesthetic. '), ('Anglo Gothic', 'Anglo Gothic is a Regional Gothic aesthetic based on the atmosphere of dingy suburban English areas with an emphasis on overcast skies, drizzling rain, council estates, grime, the colour blue, and melancholy. Works that fall under this category tend to explore the themes of class, industrialism, and feature English staples such as cheap tea and biscuits. Other common themes are the hardships of labour occupations such as coal or steel mining and factory work that are common among those in the working class in England. A lot of Anglo Gothic media is influenced by the boom in council estates being built in the 1960s in England, hence a lot of imagery being evocative of that time. '), ('Angura', "Angura (アングラ) is a dark Japanese aesthetic and fashion that is often associated with the Ero-Guro art movement as well as Visual Kei. The term is derived from the Japanese pronunciation of ''underground'', which refers to its origins in underground theater. "), ('Animecore', "Animecore revolves around the early anime and anime-related media (such as video games and VOCALOID) of the 2000s, particularity cute and Moe girls. It primarily features figurines, posters, and old desks/computers that reflect the Weeaboo anime subculture of the early 2000s to mid 2010s when it was a niche community that was not accepted in mainstream society. It originated in the 2010s with Weeaboo communities such as 4chan who idealized 2000s anime. It also spread to TikTok in the 2020s when anime culture became mainstream with new members idealizing an anime community that they never got to experience. Animecore also heavily overlaps with Cutecore. Both feature similar visuals of edited image collages and pictures of rooms, and both can include darker themes. The primary difference is Cutecore's focus on Kawaii plushies and clothing, while Animecore focuses on 2000s anime figurines. Animecore is not anime on its own, but rather the images consumed outside the context of the stories anime is conveying. The aesthetic culture here is the Western fans of the Japanese genre, rather than the artistic environment within anime, which can encompass multiple aesthetics. "), ('Anime New Moon', 'Anime New Moon is an aesthetic based on a particular type of anime graphic design that was very prevalent during the mid-2000s to early 2010s and was often featured in the videos of Nightcore remixes of that time involving Trance music. Visually, it could be described as elegant, ethereal and slightly mysterious. Artworks relating to this aesthetic typically involve the night and other elements relating to it, like the moon, stars, moonlight, galaxies, etc., as well as mythological creatures relating to angels or vampires. It is a sister aesthetic of Technoneko2000, as both have influenced Nightcore as a whole. '), ('Anti-Fashion', 'Anti-Fashion is an umbrella term for various styles of dress which are explicitly contrary to the fashion of the day. Anti-fashion styles may represent an attitude of indifference or may arise from political or practical goals which make fashion a secondary priority.

It is characterized by sun-bleached, dusty, or otherwise damaged vintage clothing. '), ('Appalachian Gothic', "Appalachian Gothic is an aesthetic centering around the culture, landscape, and media of the American Appalachian mountains and the surrounding area from New York to Alabama.

However, it commonly incorporates elements from Modern Arab culture, Islamic, Persian, Moorish, and Indian culture. The name "Arabian Nights" derives from the story collection known as "1001 Arabian Nights" which has greatly influenced this aesthetic. This aesthetic is mainly based in Orientalism. Orientalism refers to the romanticized portrayal of the East (particularly the Middle East) by the West.

Artcore is mainly prevails in the Dōjin scene (independent music circles) and the Japanese rhythm game industry, and in fact, the BEMANI series played an important role on its popularization. Being a portmanteau of "Art" and "Hardcore Techno", the songs tend to have a high BPM, emotional rhythm build-ups and very peculiar dramatic atmopsheres, with most of them being piano-based, being followed only by synthethizers and electric guitars, smoothly merging electronic sounds with acoustic ones. Artcore is sometimes called "Japanese Artcore" in Western music sources to distinguish it from the subgenre of Hardcore Punk of the same name. Sometimes it may be considered a subgenre of Drum and Bass or J-Core (Japanese Hardcore). However, it heavily differs from mainstream J-Core because it tends to be less Rave-oriented and more focused on beauty. '), ('Art Deco', "Art Deco is a 20th century aesthetic that emerged in France before WW1 in the 1910s as a luxurious, highly decorated style. It flourished in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, before gradually vanishing in the late 1930s and WW2. Because of this, the style is highly associated with the 'roaring twenties', and provided an escapade from the realities of the Great Depression during the 1930s. There have been multiple revivals, some in the 1980s and multiple today. Art Deco's influence permeated everything from architecture, to film to jewelry. The style uses geometric forms, clean lines, and is often angular or streamlined. Colors are usually bold and chosen for contrast. Patterns are bold and geometric, symmetrical or asymmetrical. Expensive materials were used, both natural (exotic woods, ivory, mother-of-pearl) and manmade (chrome, stainless steel, Bakelite). The Art Deco aesthetic is also very important to Dieselpunk and Decopunk, as without it, neither would really exist. The style was in a constant and very gradual transition, from the highly ornate form of the late 1910s and early 1920s, to the more streamlined and modernistic form of the 1930s. In architecture, the late form of Art Deco from the 1930s in known as Streamline Moderne, or Art Moderne, which had a more pared-down aesthetic, incorporating curves, clean lines and minimal decoration, which developed out of the glamour and style of cruise liners and the polished efficiency of machines.

It was popular mainly between 1890 and 1910, its period ending with the outbreak of WW1. After the war, it was succeeded by Art Deco and other forms of Modernism. Art Nouveau was a reaction to the academic historicism and eclecticism of the 19th century that favoured fine arts (paintings and sculptures) over applied arts (architecture, furniture, ceramics, etc., much of what we refer to today as "design"). It was inspired by natural forms, particularly the curved lines of plants and flowers, and whiplash forms. Other defining characteristics of Art Nouveau were a sense of dynamism and movement, often given by asymmetry and by sinuous lines;, the use of modern materials, such as iron pillars with glass, and the young European women depicted as femme fatales. Art Nouveau was known under multiple names based on country or region: Jugendstil in Germany, Nieuwe Kunst in the Netherlands, Modern Style in Great Britain and Modernisme in Catalonia and Spain. Despite being highly associated with the Belle Époque, the movement didn\'t have a hegemony in Western art of the period. While innovative Art Nouveau buildings were erected around the year 1900, historicist (Neoclassical, Gothic Revival, Renaissance Revival, etc.) objects and structures were produced during the same period. Sometimes, this led to blends of historic styles and Art Nouveau. After WW1, the movement was seen as very "passé", "dated" or "out of fashion", being replaced by Art Deco and Modernism, which featured angular shapes, a machine-inspired aesthetic, and sometimes completely rejected ornamentation. The avant-garde\'s preference for simple geometric shapes was better suited to industrial production. Later, Art Nouveau inspired the psychedelic art of the 1960s. Many psychedelic concert posters from the 1960s were in fact copies of Art Nouveau posters, with only their colours and text being changed. Today, many people love Art Nouveau, and some Contemporary artists take their inspiration from this style. Nowadays, the style is best known through Alphonse Mucha\'s posters that feature young women and foliage designs. '), ('Arts and Crafts Movement', 'Arts and Crafts Movement was a worldwide aesthetics and fine arts movement closely connected to the Pre-Raphaelites that originated in the United Kingdom and expanded across the rest of Europe as well as America. William Morris was a major influence on the Arts and Crafts movement and a rising figure in late 19th century design. The movement\'s the artist and their work through craftsmanship was the answer to developing both human fulfillment and gorgeous products that could be used on a daily basis; as a direct consequence designers are more strongly connected with decorative art and design than with the "greater" arts of sculpture and painting. The arts and crafts movement in the United Kingdom arose from a growing realization that civilization needed to embrace a new set of goals when it came to product manufacturing. Its founders intended to create goods that were not only more trustworthy, but also created in a less exploitative manner. Economic and social improvement were the goals of the arts and crafts movement. It was anti-industrialism and had a significant impact on Europe\'s art. It was the dominant influence across the British Empire and, eventually, Europe until it was superseded by modernism in the 1930s. '), ('Asian Baby Girl', "The Asian Baby Girl (ABG) aesthetic is a subculture that contradicts the model minority stereotypes that are expected of Asian American women, such as being studious, obedient, and passive. It originated with Chinese American female gangsters in the 1990s but can apply to any East or Southeast Asian American ethnicity. It is now most strongly associated with Southeast Asian Americans, particularly those of Vietnamese descent. In its early stages, the term 'ABG' was associated with Asian American gangster subcultures. 'ABG' was considered derogatory and had many implications of violent behavior, low intelligence, sex work, drug usage, and assimilation of negative aspects of Western culture. Due to the decline of organized crime among Asian Americans, views of the subculture have greatly softened; now most ABGs are Asian American girls who have no gang connections and simply adopt this aesthetic to be subversive, escape academic stress, and/or gain confidence to socialize while breaking Asian stereotypes. Starting from around 2020, the ABG aesthetic spread from the United States to China."), ('Athlete', "The Athlete aesthetic is centered around sports and sportswear of any kind, whether it's worn for athletic competition or for supporting said sports team "), ('Atompunk', 'Atompunk is an aesthetic centered around a view of the future from the perspective of the 1950s and 1960s. Modern depictions tend to use a distinct, brightly-colored art style but it can also appear just as it does in the page\'s main image. It often depicts imagery associated with "traditionally American" values, particularly a belief in the nuclear family and the suburban lifestyle. But it\'s important to note that this isn\'t the Googie or Raygun Gothic aesthetic; it does not center itself around a utopian future but rather a dystopian nightmare. Atompunk is the dark underbelly of 1950s and 1960s sci-fi characterized by potential dark futures such as Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, satirical parodies of typically suburban American life such as Dad\'s Nuke and more recently satirical parodies of the Raygun Gothic and Googie aesthetic such as Futurama. '), ('Auroracore', 'Auroracore, also known as Ethereal Fantasy, is an ethereal aesthetic that revolves around the concept of otherworldly magic and is heavily inspired by fantasy media created for young girls. This genre focuses on the concept of magic being tied to the soul and the artistic interpretation of that feeling. It is dream-like, surreal, magical, otherworldly, and pure. It is the brightest, most colorful light that luminates hope in a dark world. Auroracore seems to be somewhat of a combination of Snowdrop and Unicorncore, but lacks the complete requirements to fall under those aesthetics or encompasses more than what the mentioned aesthetics requirements are. Because Auroracore is a fairly new aesthetic, the media surrounding it is limited and almost nonexistent. It primarily exists through the internet in forms such as art pieces and aesthetic boards. The aesthetic may have originated from themes relating to the Walt Disney Company. Key examples are the Disney World 50th Anniversary and D100 aesthetic styles, as well as the visuals of the Magic Happens parade. The term “Auroracore” was coined by Wiki user LucidDaydreamm in September 2021, named after an original character of LucidDaydreamm’s. '), ('Australiana', "Australiana is a contemporary style aesthetic inspired by imagery and motifs of 20th century Australian culture. The aesthetic draws heavily upon nostalgic Australian bric-a-brac and kitschy miscellanea found in Australian homes and sighted in 'the burbs' during a time of industrialisation from the 1960s onwards. Australiana incorporates Aboriginal culture and evolved as European settlers migrated to Australia in search of a 'better place' and introduced new ideas predominantly through style and cuisine through the 20th century. At the root of Australiana is a sense of irony. To embody Australiana is to understand the contradictions of Australian culture, paying homage to the past, while optimistically moving towards a more collaborative future.

'), ('Autumn Academia', "Autumn Academia is an aesthetic that revolves around the pursuit of knowledge through reading, writing and research. It is ideologically similar to its other counterparts, and visually similar to Dark Academia, but the warmer colors and the autumnal visuals set it apart. Despite retaining some of the Gothic aspects similar to other Academia aesthetics, it focuses on a cozy and snug atmosphere over a mysterious one. It may also contain elements of Halloween, such as a recurring motif of pumpkins and Jack O' Lanterns, as the aesthetic of Autumn and the aesthetic of Halloween are oftentimes very closely linked. "), ('Avant Apocalypse', 'Avant Apocalypse is a fashion aesthetic characterized by neutral maximalism and wearing pieces incorrectly. The aesthetic contains elements of Plaguecore and Post-Apocalyptic, as well as upcycling and subversive basics. It is likely that there is also some influence from apocalyptic styles of the 70s and 80s. '), ('Avant-garde', 'Avant-garde is an idea that refers to innovative or experimental concepts or works, or the group of people producing them. Pushing boundaries with his development of Cubism, Pablo Picasso was part of the early 20th-century art world’s avant-garde. In French, avant-garde means the "vanguard" or the "advance guard" — basically the people whose ideas and techniques that are ahead of their time or in advance of those generally known or accepted. Usually it refers to a movement in the arts, like Dadaism, or in politics, like anarchism. The term can also be used as an adjective to describe something that’s cutting-edge. Avant-garde design has traditionally made up only a small percentage of manufactured goods, yet its influence on the history of design has been enormous. Generally, works and ideas of this type have had an impact far beyond the audiences made of small circles for whom they were primarily intended. Usually, some years must pass for an avant-garde concept or design to catch up. For example, Marcel Breuer\'s pioneering tubular metal furniture from the late 1920s and 1930s was not nearly as widely accepted in its own day as it was in the 1960s and 70s. The work of the avant-garde is frequently given the adjective "New" - New Art, Art Nouveau, New Wave - to describe its forward-looking agenda. '), ('Babycore', 'Babycore involves "gentle", muted" colors "Pastel" or "cute" childlike innocence. This aesthetic leans toward softer, more Kawaii elements, and is distinguished from Kidcore through its usage of lighter colors and visuals typically reserved for babies and toddlers as opposed to school-aged children. It also differs from both Softie and Dollette(which it is often mistaken for) in that it is much frillier and more childish, and from Babygirl in that it lacks suggestive or nsfw undertones. Morute is also similar to Babycore but with dark, creepy, or gothic elements that are not found in Babycore. Babycore is inspired by soft, kawaii, and girly aesthetics, namely Yume Kawaii, Delicate Sweet, and Sweet Lolita/Boystyle, and also often has some Kitschy and Sanriocore/Melodycore elements. It is also very similar to the Puppycore subtype of Petcore. Babycore is also sometimes known as Softcore or Softette, although it can be said that Babycore focuses more on the baby-like visuals whereas Softcore/Softette is the fashion side of things(specifically the hyperfeminine fashion not more gender neutral styles). It is important to note, since many people get confused, that Babycore is NOT interchangeable with being an ABDL or the adult baby community. Babycore is also often associated with age regression/littlespace, although not everyone who enjoys this aesthetic uses it to enter a younger headspace and not everyone who engages in age regression or ageplay has this aesthetic. '), ('Babygirl', "Babygirl is an aesthetic taken from the BDSM subgenre of DDLG(Daddy Dom and Little Girl/Babygirl). Babygirl encompasses sweet and innocent imagery and attitudes that give the adult wearer an overall childlike feel. This aesthetic is similar to the soft girl or kawaii style. The Babygirl aesthetic is inspired by Soft Girl, Erokawa, and Babycore, but with the substyles can vary from Bubblegum Bitch or Bimbocore to E-Girl or Pastel Goth. Often this can cross over with bratty attitudes and behavior; this means the sweet and submissive nature can morph into teasing, pouting, tantrums, entitlement, and a compulsion to challenge others. These childish themes allow the person to release typical adult stressors and fall into a more easy and comfortable state of mind as a stress relief technique sometimes known as voluntary age regression or littlespace. Although, this aspect in its depth is not required or utilized by all in the community and is reliant on individual preference. The main purpose of this aesthetic, seperate from the sexual part, is to allow adults to feel and reclaim childhood wonderment and comfort, and to also overcome obstacles from abuse (similar to Traumacore's purpose) and heal while still maintaining a more matured sense of style and dignity. Be advised when searching terms related to this aesthetic as the results will show explicit content aimed at adults 18+.

"), ('Bakala', "Bakalas, also known as Makineros, are a music-based subculture that originated in the Valencian Community, eastern Spain, which formed around the musical genres of Mákina or Bakalao. It was rooted in Spain's clubbing culture during the Spanish transition to democracy and the Movida Valenciana and mainly flourished during the 1980s, 1990s and to a lesser extent the 2000s. One of these clubbing movements was the Ruta Destroy or Ruta del Bakalao, which was the first one in Spain and the largest one ever. People from various corners of Europe would drive over to the city of Valencia to experience its nightlife. Stereotypically, Bakalas were described as low-middle class people who were interested in Electronic Dance Music (and most notably Mákina/ Bakalao). It was also a type of nightlife in the city of Valencia, where thousands of young people would host Hard Techno parties, stay up for several days and consume drugs, although that also brought really bad medical and legal consequences for the scene. Nowadays, the Bakala movement has evidently fallen out of popularity, although it's remembered by many nostalgic adults in the country. "), ('Ballet Academia', 'Ballet Academia or Balletic is an aesthetic that takes aspects from many different academias and focuses them on ballet and the classical dance world. It takes the already-present romanticism of ballets themselves and gears it towards the academia culture. It includes imagery from classical and contemporary ballet, as well as modern and post-modern dance (particularly from the techniques of Lester Horton and Martha Graham). It is extremely broad and varied, much as the imagery of classical dance itself is. It can be Gothic and dark (for example, Suspiria and Black Swan), ethereal and light (An American in Paris and The Glass Slipper), the academic and practical (The Turning Point and Dance Academy) or a mix of all of three (The Red Shoes and Princess Tutu). There is also a great deal of fairy tale and mythological references involved, as much of ballet and modern dance pieces often feature supernatural subject matter. Typical symbolism usually involves swans, wings, and black and white contrasts (as much of the stereotypical imagery comes from Swan Lake and La Sylphide.) In literature and film it often features tropes of ballet being a melodramatic, tragic, agonizing, and overly-insulated world. As these stereotypes are taken more from the fantasy of the plots of ballets themselves than from the reality of the dance world (which is a small, but supportive community of artists), these tropes are unnecessary to the aesthetic. It can be appreciated equally by ballet/modern dance aficionados as much as actual dancers (professional or not). '), ('Balletcore', 'Balletcore is an aesthetic and fashion trend that originated in the early 2020s on Tiktok, but started to attract mainstream attention in late 2022. The aesthetic is strongly associated with Coquette, a hyper-feminine aesthetic among teenaged girls.

The style is based on either the practice outfits or the performance costumes of professional ballet dancers, which includes very specific trends and textiles that developed separately from mainstream fashion. Throughout fashion trends, ballet has always had some influence, but with this trend, the trend was more explicit, with the entire outfit being ballet-inspired, as well as the name being prominent.

The aesthetic also includes more "girly" 2000s television series like Lizzie McGuire and Hannah Montana, which focused on middle class American families. These shows encouraged confidence, female friendships, freedom, and girl power. Other products produced for tweens and teens in the early 2000s, like Lip Smackers, are also part of the aesthetic. Imagery from a more upper-class lifestyle created by the Barbie toy line and movies, which includes multiple cars, a private jet, huge house, multiple pets including horses, and a yacht, is also found in this aesthetic, especially when the items are pink. '), ('Bardcore', 'Bardcore (also known as Tavernwave) is a music genre that arranges modern pop-songs such as "What is Love", "Pumped up Kicks" or "Astronomia" to sound medieval and "old-timey".

'), ('Baroque', 'Baroque is a term used to describe the predominant art movement and style of European architecture, music, and art of the 17th and early 18th centuries. The term "Baroque" originated from the Portuguese word barroco, which means "misshapen pearl." Barroco was used first to criticize the overly ornate music of the Baroque era. It was later also applied to art, fashion, and architecture of the period, but eventually lost its pejorative tone. Though relatively minor, the 20th and 21st centuries have seen a renewed and prolonged interest in Baroque music, art, and motifs. Famously, Dolce and Gabbana\'s 2012 collection of Baroque-inspired clothing confirmed a subtle, decades-long trend: a comeback for some of the Baroque era\'s most recognizable patterns and colors.

It was developed during the 1980s. Respectivily, it is heavily influenced by the politics of the Basque Country and its culture. Musically, it is heavily influenced by Ska-Punk, Urban Rock and Reggae music. Coindicing and contrasting with La Movida in the rest of Spain, Basque Radical Rock was a really important influence on Spanish Rock music during the 1980s, especially in Bilbao. The singers and musicians associated with the Basque Radical Rock movement were heavily obscene, disrespectful and politically incorrect but in an ironic way, although it's worth noting that the area of the Basque Country was going through pretty though political times, including the presence of terrorist groups such as the Euskadi ta Askatasuna (ETA), and this was reflected in their music, some of which faced censorship due to its emphasis on offensive topics. Regardless, the singers were predominantly left-wing, aligning with the goals and causes of the original Punk movement.

Venom\'s sound was closer to thrash metal, but laid the groundwork for future bands to polish, while Bathory was the first band to posess all the characteristic aspects of the black metal sound. The early years of black metal (approximately 1981 - 1987) was known as the first wave of black metal. Around this time, black metal was really just thrash and speed metal with satanic/anti-christian themes with the main difference in the music itself being the lower production quality. Then in 1984, the band Bathory was (if not the first) band in the scene to use the shrieked vocals that are commonly associated with black metal. other notable examples of first wave black metal would be Celtic Frost, Hellhammer, and Mercyful Fate.

The other influence of the name is the emphasis on a "signature scent," with cinnamon scents being highly connotative of coziness and autumn. One of the interpretations of the aesthetic is of a more youthful and trendy take on the Autumn VSCO aesthetic. Here, the aesthetic revolves around autumn-themed domesticity, especially baking, but with a more luxury, coquette, and Downtown Girl interpretation with updated fashion pieces and a more romantic image. Much of the inspiration also comes from Gilmore Girls, a TV show taking place in a charming autumnal New England town. The second interpretation is more in line with Clean Girl, where instead of the spring-themed pastels and spa-like pale colors, the colors are warm-toned. Similar to the other interpretation, there are more images of urban and luxury elements. The tag on TikTok most often brings up videos of young women lip-syncing to the song, with a caption that begins with "Cinnamon Girl is for..." with the rest of the caption describing types of sensitive, introverted, and hurt young women looking for love, as the original song describes. This, however, does not have an aesthetic component, as the videos lack a visual component other than the poster lip-syncing. '), ('City Pop', "City Pop (シティーポップ) is an old genre of Pop music from Japan. It began in the mid-1970s, rising to the peak of its popularity in the late-1970s and 1980s. It also spread to other areas of Asia, particularly establishing a foothold in Hong Kong, where many covers of popular City Pop songs were popularized in Cantopop. It is also considered a predecessor to modern J-Pop (though it certainly has more of a sophisticated vibe to it compared to modern J-Pop). Various City Pop songs are sampled in many Future Funk songs. Famous City Pop artists include, Mariya Takeuchi, Taeko Onuki, Miki Matsubara, Anri, Naoko Gushima, Tatsuro Yamashita, Junko Yagami, etc. Much of City Pop was also influenced by 80s Japanese New Wave artists, such as YMO, Akiko Yano, Ippu-Do, and Sandii and the Sunsetz. All of these artists worked with members of Japan, the British New Romantic band, who also experimented with and influenced City Pop. (A few other British artists in this genre include Virginia Astley and The Dolphin Brothers.) There are many City Pop compilations on YouTube for people to listen to, with channels such as Ganymede Cafe making 40 minute long compilations of City Pop songs. Many of these songs are played in the background of an old anime GIF on loop. City Pop is considered an aesthetic genre of music due to its casual and upbeat nature. Despite the best years of City Pop being behind the genre, the spirit of it lives on as sometimes it'll be interspersed with Vaporwave (and a lot of Vaporwave artists will sample City Pop in their songs to invoke the imagery of sophisticated Japan on the rise in the 80's and 90's) and a lot of City Pop aesthetics will find themselves tied to the Lo-Fi aesthetic, thus ensuring City Pop's legacy in internet aesthetic history. "), ('Classic Academia', 'Classic Academia is a subgenre of Academia that involves the inclusion of broader interests, topics, and subject matter than its other, more well known aesthetics. It is the defining halfway point between Dark Academia and Light Academia, both thematically and in color palette. Like Dark and Light Academia, it borrows its visuals and music heavily from the 19th and 20th centuries as well as from antiquity. '), ('Classicism', 'Classicism in the arts, refers generally to a high regard for a classical period, classical antiquity in the Western tradition, as setting standards for taste which the classicists seek to emulate. The art of classicism typically seeks to be formal and restrained. It is a specific genre of philosophy, expressing itself in literature, architecture, art, and music, which has Ancient Greek and Roman sources and an emphasis on society. Although not directly related, in some situations, Classicism can be politicized by white nationalists with the intention of creating an impression of "Western culture" from many diverse cultures. This can then be portrayed as "what we [the white race] are protecting," an ahistorical medley of very different "white" cultures. Note that while this may be difficult to distinguish from legitimate cultural study in some cases, that is the purpose of such politicization; it prevents everyone from immediately seeing through the veil of cryptofascism. This by no means forms the majority of the classicist aesthetic, however (and thankfully). '), ('Cleancore', 'Cleancore (also known as Safetycore or Hygienicore) refers to an aesthetic based around clean objects or objects intended to sanitize. It includes soaps, sponges, and bathtubs, as well as places that may seem to have been recently cleaned. It can be divided into two subaesthetics, each of which looks vastly different - High Cleancore deals with the adult world and products aimed at adults, such as washed-out soaps and sterile hotel rooms, while Low Cleancore deals with products aimed at children, such as bath toys and rubber ducks, and may have overlap with Babycore and Kidcore. As a continuation of many of its predecessors, Cleancore cynically embraces capitalist imagery, yet at the same time, taps into its anxiety-stricken audience, becoming a particularly popular aesthetic to try and achieve during the COVID-19 pandemic. '), ('Clean Girl', 'The Clean Girl aesthetic is a microtrend that focuses on a minimalist and fresh approach to beauty and fashion. It embraces a natural and effortless look while maintaining a polished and clean appearance. This aesthetic gained popularity through social media platforms, particularly TikTok and Instagram, where influencers and users share their clean girl-inspired outfits, beauty routines, and lifestyle choices. It is closely connected to the That Girl aesthetic. '), ('Clockpunk', "Clockpunk is a Steampunk sub-group, Cyberpunk-derivative that portrays Renaissance-era science and technology based on pre-modern designs. It involves, as the name suggests, clocks. Keys, padlocks, old suitcases, phonographs, typewriters and gears and other intricate mechanisms are included. Key colors include gold, brown, yellow, and white, reminiscent of metals and it's alloys It is closely intertwined with the steampunk aesthetic, Clockpunk focuses on the gears and cogs of clockwork, the detail of the mechanisms. "), ('Clowncore', 'Clowncore (also known as Circuscore or Clownpunk) surrounds things such as clowns, mimes, and jesters. Content from this aesthetic is usually bright and happy, although some portrayals of clowncore can have horror influences. Other related aesthetics similar to clowncore can also have dark and disturbing content (clussy). The modern revival of this aesthetic was primarily fueled by the no longer active expressionist, Chase Rebecca, otherwise known as NewWorldEgo by the aesthetic community. '), ('Club', ' The Club aesthetic is centered around entertainment venues and bars that usually operate late into the night. A nightclub is generally distinguished from regular bars, pubs or taverns by the inclusion of a stage for live music, one or more dance floor areas and a DJ booth, where a DJ plays recorded music. '), ('Club Kids', 'Club Kids were a group of young New York City dance club personalities led by Michael Alig and James St. James in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Several Club Kids have made long-lasting contributions to mainstream art and fashion, even in the present day. In many ways, the vast majority of the aesthetics on the Aesthetics Wiki owe their very existence to the Club Kids of the 1980s. A movie about the Club Kids was made through World of Wonder Productions (the same production company behind the world-famous RuPaul\'s Drag Race) called Party Monster starring Seth Green as James St. James and Macaulay Culkin as Michael Alig based on the novel James St. James wrote entitled Disco Bloodbath (which was renamed to Party Monster after the success of the movie). While it fell dormant for a while after Rudy Giuliani started cracking down on the rampant drug use in New York City some time in the mid-1990\'s thanks to his "Quality of Life" crackdowns, the Club Kid aesthetic has started to see a resurgence with a brand new generation, although the Nu-Club Kids definitely seem to have a more introverted nature to them compared to the rowdy and raucous Club Kids of old. '), ('Cluttercore', 'Cluttercore is a highly personalized, cluttered aesthetic popularized largely by Gen-Z and is an opposing aesthetic of minimalism. People can more generally consider it an, "organized mess". '), ('Coastal Cowgirl', 'Coastal Cowgirl is a fairly recent aesthetic originating in between spring and summer of 2023 and is a juxtaposition between Western and Nautical. It seems to be an offshoot of the Coastal Grandmother aesthetic, but with more of a whimsical vibe that is more country-inspired from the likes of older 2000s media such as old Taylor Swift music and Hannah Montana. Its origins are mainly in the coastal areas of the United States such as North Carolina. '), ('Coastal Grandmother', '"Coastal grandmother is in step with other millennial trends: a powerful love affair with wine, a resurgence of book clubs, an interest in “whole” foods and simple cooking." - Glamour, April 26, 2022'), ('Cocalar', 'Cocalar (or plurally, Cocalari) is a slang term used in Romania to describe a subculture of adult men who stereotypically wear kitschy clothing, have a "poor" or "ridiculous" taste in fashion, participate in BMW car culture, wear lots of gold, jewels or glitter and have multiple tattoos, among other stereotypes. The Cocalari tend to express themselves through a loud and outstanding appareance rather than their personality or actions. The signature musical genre associated with this subculture is Manele. The feminine equivalent of a Cocalar is a Pițipoancă. The term Cocalar or Cocalari tends to be used pejoratively, although regardless, some people in Romania proudly identify with it. The Romanian word cocalar is derived from the Romani word kòkalo, hence why this aesthetic is sometimes associated with the Roma minority. Nowadays the term Cocalar is being phased out in popularity and as Romanian society shifts the modern equivalent is a Bombardier; another similiar phenomenom emerging in the late 2010s. '), ('Coconut Girl', 'Coconut Girl (also known as Malibu Barbie and Key West Kitten) is a Coquette subtype centers around the Nymphet interpretation of tropical beaches typically associated with Florida from the 1960s to the 2000s. It creates an atmosphere that expresses the femininity and youth associated with young women vacationing during the summertime. The aesthetic has multiple interpretations; while in the beginning, it was known among the Nymphet community, it later gained more mainstream appeal and was connected to other beach-related aesthetics such as VSCO and surf culture. Because of this, visuals may differ and is connected to the practice of mass-tagging. '), ('Coffee House/Cafe', 'Coffee House (also known as Café) is an aesthetic that relates to the qualities of a café. It commonly incorporates the warm or neutral color blends, calm settings, warm lighting. '), ('Coffinwood', 'Coffinwood is an aesthetic term coined in late 2020 by Tumblr user Roy The Drifter, meant to be a direct response to Cottagecore and to go against the aesthetics dominant among the younger Millennial and Generation Z populace, despite Roy being a late Millennial himself.Coffinwood is rural and rustic, but it is darker, more masculine and melancholic in its character. There is a sense of nostalgia and a reverence for the past and for Americana and older pop culture as well as an active rejection of more modern views typical of the Millennials and Generation Z. However, that nostalgic reverence is also melancholic and is often paired with sentiments of paranoia and fear as well as the feeling that the world has gone insane and society is on the brink, with the only hope being to preserve and revere the past and to "clock out" of the mainstream society and live in the countryside. '), ('Comfy/Cozy', "Comfy or Cozy is an aesthetic that relates to the feeling of being comfortably at rest with your surroundings, neatly fit in your place, relieved and well-suited. It includes having pets, reading books, and sitting next to a fireplace or window, or on a bed. Usually associated with Autumn and pumpkin spices, and with swift movements instead of challenges. Others also include reading, sleeping, watching movies or just doing nothing whilst at ease and petting your dog/cat. Specific themes associated are messy beds as the symbolize one's unwillingness to wake up, and dreams (either be asleep or wish to). While the aesthetic is not as predominant on the several social media sites out there yet, such as Instagram, TikTok, and others, the community notably began and prospered on Tumblr. It should be noted that this aesthetic sometimes is confused with Light Academia due to similar color palette and some key values. However, one main difference between the two is that Light Academia(and all aesthetics with the Academia suffix, for that matter) is that it is focused on learning, studying, and a thirst for knowledge. Comfy/Cozy's main idea is being comfortable, relaxed, and happy. "), ('Communist Chic', 'Communist Chic refers to the phenomenon of communist symbols and aesthetics being appropriated and accommodated within mainstream media and the Chic fashion trends surrounding it, notably in the United States but also in other countries of the former Western Bloc. This involves the use of imagery associated with political movements like Marxism, Leninism, socialism, communism and Juche, including the hammer and sickle, red stars, red flags, or pictures of prominent political figures like Che Guevara. These symbols may be incorporated into various aspects of popular culture, ranging from clothing to accessories and even music videos and film sets, and those who use them might not fully understand what the symbols mean. Some of it may be used as a form of shock content or counterculture (just like Nazi Chic), while other people may purely "normalize" it or detach from the meaning of the symbology involved. This often results in backlash because they can be considered offensive to others, and they are even illegal in certain countries and promote stereotypes (See Criticism). '), ('Corporate', 'Corporate is an aesthetic that relates to business attire that refers to the clothing that employees wear to work. Depending on the workplace, various levels of the formality of business attire are expected, and the norm. The dress codes range from traditional and formal to smart casual, business casual, and casual. '), ('Corporate Memphis', 'Corporate Memphis is a minimalist visual aesthetic. Taking Flat Design and blending it with shades of Corporate and the original Memphis Design, this art style aims to create visuals that are easy to mass produce and utilize for commercial purposes. Although a Memphis Revival did occur from the mid 2010s onward, the term "Corporate Memphis" has become indelibly attached to an illustration style pioneered by Facebook. "Alegria" was developed by media agency Buck for Facebook and launched in 2017. Nowadays, imitations of the style are widely seen in various websites, advertisements, logos, and even user interfaces. As a result, there has been a growing awareness for this minimalist look, with many people complaining about the monotony and oversaturation of the style. '), ('Cottagecore', 'Cottagecore is an aesthetic inspired by a romanticized interpretation of western agricultural life, particularly in the past. It is centered on ideas of simple living and harmony with nature. Other themes associated with cottagecore include self-sufficiency, the romanticization of domestic labor, and caring for people. While the aesthetic is prevalent on several social media sites, such as on Instagram and more recently TikTok, the community originated on Tumblr. However, this is an internet and visual-centered look on prior decorative, literary, and historical trends. It is particularly popular within woman-loving-woman (WLW) and nonbinary loving women (NBLW) communities (although sexuality does not define the aesthetic and it is also commonly seen among straight Tradwives). The aesthetic is a continuation of many other nature-based aesthetics, but draws the most influence from the 19th century Romantic era and its romanticization of pre-industrial life. Its visuals are based on the domestic lifestyle associated with living in this type of environment, with all images providing a sense of comfort and mild adventure. Despite a number of its followers taking a progressive and subversive outlook, Cottagecore has been also criticized for its romanticism of eurocentric farming life. It has also been criticized in the context of North American and Australian settings, an inadvertent celebration of the aesthetics of colonialism, as well as the ways it often simplifies and underestimates the labor of farmers. It is due to these connotations that the use of Cottagecore aesthetics has been adopted by the TradWife community and members of the far-right as forms of propaganda. This has led to media criticism despite their opposition to LGBTQ+ and anti-capitalist adherents of Cottagecore. Also, due to the fact that Cottagecore is based on pre-industrial farm life which existed all around the world, it does not have to be exclusively based on European history and in fact is partially inspired by the Japanese aesthetic Morí Kei. Cottagecore is often compared to aesthetics such as Grandparentcore and Shabby Chic, which seek to evoke a similar sense of nostalgia. It is also related to Naturecore and Warmcore. Fairycore and Fairytale are similar to Cottagecore but with a more magical, Ethereal twist. Country and Farmcore are also very similar to Cottagecore except with a focus on modern agricultural life. '), ('Cottagegore', 'Cottagegore (also known as Goth Cottagecore or Dark Cottagecore) is similar to Cottagecore, in the sense it has a strong focus on country life, baking, and vintage items, but contrary to its name, it instead includes darker aspects of nature (including rotten mushroom or plant aesthetics, forest cryptids, spirits or ghosts, and bones found in nature) as opposed to just taking the Cottagecore aesthetic and throwing a bunch of blood and gore on it. It tends to also cross over with other dark aesthetics, like Dark Academia, Crowcore, and Vulture Culture. '), ('Coquette Academia', 'Coquette Academia is described as a softer, feminine academia. Though similar to light academia, its central themes are much more feminine in nature. It is based on the aesthetics of romantic academia and coquette/dollette. It centers around being both feminine and smart. Because coquette derives from nymphet and is generally associated with teenage girlhood, coquette academia has more of an association with high school(although it can be college as well), where other academia aesthetics like romantic academia are focused specifically on higher education, particularly prestigious universities. Images of ballet shoes or young girls dancing ballet are also included in this aesthetic, as ballet dance is very common in dollette looks, especially classical ballet, and not to mention that ballet classes are found a lot in arts academies, mainly aimed at a feminine side or in any media that treats this in a delicate, fantasy and feminine way. (See the Ballet Academia and Balletcore page). There can also be a darker version of coquette academia, inspired by dark academia(as opposed to light academia) and dark coquette. '), ('Corporate Hippie', "Corporate Hippie (spelt 'Hippy' in British English), also referred to as Capitalist Hippie or Corporate Psychedelica, was an aesthetic and marketing tactic prevalent from the Late-1960s to the Mid-1970s that attempted to appropriate the 1960s counterculture and Hippie movement for corporate applications. "), ('Country', 'Country as aesthetic and music genre is based on the culture of rural farming populations in the southern United States and the Midwest. Farmers and ranchers within the community value tradition and conservative ideals, community, and hard work in their field. The aesthetic places great emphasis on practicality, with a range of activities and items originating from their work and landscape. The style is popular with many people throughout the United States, even if they are not farmers or ranchers, and has been used as a visual trope for weddings, settings for TV shows, and political propaganda. Visually, the aesthetic shares many traits with Western, but there is no emphasis on the 19th century, adventure or lawlessness, and instead focuses on the idea of home and being settled within the farmer lifestyle. And unlike Cottagecore, which romanticizes the countryside and uses feminine aesthetics, Country is a lived reality, even if some visual tropes are used to the point of excess. The people who participate in this aesthetic are unlikely to be aware of the aesthetic community as a whole. The lifestyle has cemented itself among the American mainstream, with it being a theme of multiple home decorating magazines, clothing brands, and even personality types. It is a point of pride for many people to be a "country girl/boy," as their culture emphasizes patriotism and values that are atypical for many modern cities. '), ('Cozy Childhood Hideaway', 'Cozy Childhood Hideaway describes spaces one, though these are oriented towards children, can use as a refuge and a hiding place, whether to escape danger or simply to be alone. These spaces are both small enough to avoid being found for as long as one wants and large enough to be comfortable. Hideaway spaces are typically associated with children, as these comfortable spaces are seen as childhood things that older people grow out of both physically and mentally as teenagers face the world. However, adulthood has many cozy aspects, especially linked with more domestic practices, which can be seen in Comfy/Cozy.Note: This aesthetic has been previously called Havencore and was more oriented towards a personal/created aesthetics community, which is not allowed on the Aesthetics Wiki. Searching "Havencore" would bring many posts centered around this childhood coziness. '), ('C-Pop', 'C-pop is an abbreviation for Chinese popular music, a loosely defined musical genre by artists originating from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Others come from countries where the Chinese language is used by much of the population, such as Singapore and Malaysia. C-pop is sometimes used as an umbrella term covering not only Chinese pop but also R&B, ballads, Chinese rock, Chinese hip-hop, and Chinese ambient music, although Chinese rock diverged during the early 1990s. '), ('Crackhead', 'Crackhead (not to be confused with Drugcore enthusiasts, who are sometimes crackheads as not all involved in Drugcore actually do drugs) is an aesthetic centered around being chaotic, unpredictable, stupid, clumsy, lazy, and inconvenient people, often labelled as "dumbasses". The term is very popular on Tumblr and among school kids. The aesthetic has no relations with actual drugs. Chaos and signs of \'dumbassery\' can be found everywhere, and so can spilled foods, chipped fingernails, wet socks, lost wallets, unbrushed hair, disorganized workspaces, etc, which are all examples of the eternal presence of a Crackhead. '), ('Craftcore', 'Craftcore is themed around hand-crafted items. The most popular craftcore visual and activity is embroidery, but the aesthetic encompasses a variety of other craft activities and crafted items. '), ('Cripplepunk', 'Cripplepunk (also known as c-punk, Crippunk, or Cr*pple Punk, able-bodied people should use these terms to refer to it due to the word "cripple" being a slur) is a movement that focuses on disability pride, exclusively for physical disabilities. Cripplepunk involves accepting and loving oneself for, not despite of, disabilities, mobility aids, and the struggles that come with them. It also rejects the myth of disabled people as "inspirational" heroes simply because they have a disability, and that they have to be perfectly nice and submissive to be respected by able-bodied people. Many people involved in Cripplepunk bond over their struggles, being treated as lesser by able-bodied people, and the ableism in the medical industry and society as a whole. Cripplepunk is for physically disabled people specifically. '), ('Crowcore', 'Crowcore is primarily derived from Goblincore and Cottagecore. This aesthetic focuses mainly on nature, environmentalism, crows and collecting (usually shiny) objects from nature and urban environments. Crowcore is generally darker than either of its initial inspirations. Crowcore is sometimes used as an alternative to Goblincore, which has been criticized as anti-Semitic, but which shares the value of collecting small, lost, broken, thrown away, or conventionally trivial objects, and nature visuals. There is significant Tumblr cross-tagging between Crowcore, Gremlincore, Cottagecore, and various other related aesthetics. '), ('Cryptid Academia', 'Cryptid Academia is an aesthetic based off of Dark Academia and Cryptidcore. It was inspired by the aesthetic of cryptozoologists and journalists in the 1960s. '), ('Cryptidcore', 'Cryptidcore is an aesthetic traditionally associated with Cryptozoology, or the study of creatures from urban legends and folklore, and the romanticization of the adventure and mystery surrounding conspiracy theories, ghost-hunting, cryptid-hunting, and the supernatural. Most fans of the aesthetic are a part of, or want to be a part of, a community that gets to solve something beyond themselves with their friends and witness something strange and fantastical. Alternatively, some people interested in the aesthetic empathize or even want to be a cryptid themselves. Many parts of Cryptidcore have been inspired from media associated with cryptids and conspiracies, such as Gravity Falls, Twin Peaks, Welcome to Night Vale, Sightings, Unsolved Mysteries and The X-Files. Cryptidcore enthusiasts are often fans of these fictional works, and a love for cryptids and mysteries often comes from the love for the original works. The visual aspects of Cryptidcore originate largely from the places these cryptids are allegedly located in (mostly the forests and deserts of the United States), as well as the kitschy tourist trap culture capitalizing on the people who have a fascination with these cryptids. Cryptidcore is also generally vintage, and takes visual inspiration, especially in regard to fashion, from the 1970s - 90s. This is largely due to the rise of tabloids and fiction revolving around these mysteries during that time. '), ('Cubism', 'Cubism is an early 20th century avant-garde art movement that revolutionized European painting and sculpture, and inspired related movements in music, literature and architecture. Cubism has been considered the most influential art movement of the 20th century. The movement was pioneered by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, joined by Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Robert Delaunay, Henri Le Fauconnier, and Fernand Léger. One primary influence that led to Cubism was the representation of three-dimensional form in the late works of Paul Cézanne. '), ('Cuddle Party', ' The Cuddle Party aesthetic is centered around positive feelings and a youthful/nostalgic vibe without delving as much into some of the childish elements of Kidcore. It\'s more in line with the moment and thinking about the good memories than with any sort of material element. This is generally an aesthetic embraced by more extroverted individuals and doesn\'t have an ounce of cynicism behind it like most other aesthetics. The old MTV show Sifl & Olly would probably describe this particular aesthetic as "crescent fresh". '), ('Cultcore', 'Cultcore is an aesthetic centered around the themes of cults. It often involves imagery that hints towards idealization, religious symbols, mind control, and god complexes. From a media standpoint, Cultcore media is based on stories, real or false, of people following false, unrealistic leaders and ideals and the longing for purity but being corrupted. It can also consist of escaping or overthrowing a cult when it comes to a visual story or the stories in the media. '), ('Cult Party Kei', "Cult Party Kei (カルトパーティー系) is a Japanese vintage fashion with a focus on many sheer layers and religious imagery. The name is derived from the store Cult Party which popularized that style, but the name isn't actually used much in Japan. Cult Party Kei is often confused with Mori Kei. "), ('Cutecore', 'Note: There is a misconception that "cutecore" is a non-culturally appropriating word for kawaii. This is not the topic of the page. The claim that "kawaii" is an inappropriate term was created by trolls on 4chan and does not reflect the beliefs of the kawaii community and Japanese people.Cutecore (also known as Cutegore) is an online aesthetic including image edits that combine typical kawaii imagery with slight traces of gore. Characters are often depicted with wounds, blood splatters, glitches, pixelations, and otherwise horrific motifs, as well as bedrooms with kawaii decor and bloodstains on the wall or tall dark figures. The aesthetic is often conflated with Kawaii over its name, when in reality the term "Cutecore" was choosen in order to avoid shadowbans on social media triggered by mentions of the term "gore". '), ('Cyberdelic', "Cyberdelic (also known as Cyberdelia) is a term used to the immersion in cyberspace as a psychedelic experience. It was the fusion of cyberculture and the psychedelic subculture into a new counterculture of the late 1980s to mid-1990s. Much like the Hippies and Psychedelica, Cyberdelic is consistently linked with the Cyberpunk aesthetic of the '80s, though it should be noted the two are separate aesthetics in their own right. It also has overlap with Early Cyber. "), ('Cyberghetto', 'Cyberghetto is an aesthetic that intends to create a home on cyberspace for marginalized groups of people. The word is a compound of Cyber (referring to the internet and cyberspace) and Ghetto (generally used as a term to describe a group of marginalized individuals). '), ('Cyber Grunge', 'Cyber Grunge is an aesthetic that combines Grunge, Streetwear, and Y2K Futurism, sometimes with slight military influences, and is most prevalent in China and South Korea. It is characterized by bold silhouettes, utilitarian features, and an infusion of futuristic elements. As a fashion it is largely based around the utilization of "subversive basics", or simple clothing with alternative or avant garde details such as cut-outs, mesh, and pockets. The influence of Y2K is also incredibly common in the style, with the accessories, prints, and silhouettes being from this era. '), ('Cybergoth', 'Cybergoth is a subculture characterized by its unique take on a post-apocalyptic worldview that is expressed mainly with fashion and music. Beyond being part of the larger Goth subculture, Cybergoth has also been heavily associated with the industrial music scene which can be typically seen in the form of the "industrial dancing" performed by members of the subculture. Cyberpop would be a similar style but with a focus on retro-futurism and bright colors. '), ('Cyberparadism', 'Cyberparadism is a subset of Cyberprep, revolving around, as its name says "A cyber paradise". It differs itself from Cyberprep that not only the positive benefits of technological progress are a central tenet, but that said technological progress has reached a level of sophistication where the principles of economics and conventional labour are fundamentally transformed in such that the subjects at hand can and are likely to pursue higher goals of scientific, technological, civilizatory and/or spiritual fulfillment. This pursuit of higher goals is reflected in the societal structures of Cyberparadism. While smaller communities or highly dense urban pods are common, they are often highly interconnected and work towards shared goals, such as preserving the environment or advancing scientific research. This emphasis on cooperation and shared purpose is a hallmark of Cyberparadism, and is made possible by the advanced technology that has allowed for a post-scarcity society. In Cyberparadism, the paradisal aspect is not just a surface-level aesthetic choice, but a fundamental part of the subgenre\'s philosophy. By incorporating technology in a way that enhances and preserves the natural world, Cyberparadism offers a vision of a future that is not only sustainable, but also fulfilling and meaningful for its inhabitants. It challenges the assumption that progress must come at the expense of the environment, and presents a hopeful alternative where humans and nature can thrive together in harmony.tl;dr Cyberparadism in a nutshell is an aesthetic that features lots of untamed nature, usually tropical or jungle-like, where a small-numbered breakaway civilization uses highly-advanced technology (but not hard science-fiction, unrealistic, too distant future) for self-preservation and/or luxurious comfort that enables a quasi-hedonistic lifestyle. Common themes are genetic life engineering, terraformation, exoplanets or other types of space frontiers.'), ('Cyberpop', 'Cyberpop is a retro-futuristic style that first emerged in Japan during the 90s under the more generic name "cyber fashion" (サイバーファッション). It is characterized by some fantasy, Y2K Futurism, a positive aura, and a stylized clean outline, as opposed to Cyberpunk and Cybergoth, which is rather negative and dark (post-apocalyptic). '), ('Cyberprep', 'Cyberprep is a term referring to a society that has developed in the same aspects of Cyberpunk but towards an utopian direction, with fair law and no world-controlling corporations. Since society is largely leisure-driven, advanced body modifications are used for sports, pleasure and self-improvement. The word is an amalgam of the prefix "cyber-," referring to cybernetics, and "preppy," reflecting the aesthetic\'s clean look in common with clothes associated with being preppy. '), ('Cyberpunk', 'Cyberpunk, as a genre, includes a wide variety of visual aesthetics but is recognized by its encompassing theme of "high tech, low life". This became prominent in the 1980s. thanks to the works of authors like Philip K. Dick, Roger Zelazny, J. G. Ballard, Philip Jose Farmer, William Gibson and Harlan Ellison as they examined the impact of drug culture, technology, and the sexual revolution while avoiding the utopian tendencies of earlier science fiction. Settings in the cyberpunk genre range from the richly (neon) colored, rough-around-the-edges urban jungles of Akira (1988), to the hyper-futuristic, neon cityscapes and bleak wastelands of Blade Runner 2049 (2017), with the first work in cyberpunk fiction being Katsuhiro Otomo\'s AKIRA manga (1982). William Gibson\'s Neuromancer (1984) novel has been credited as another defining magnum opus of the genre. Cyberpunk narratives often incorporate a sense of hopelessness or nihilism, typically featuring a gritty and violent backdrop, with crime, artificial intelligence, class uprising, governmental and corporate corruption, anarchy, gang warfare, and transhumanism all being central themes. The range is broad but the combination of these themes in the cyberpunk aesthetic is often used to convey deeper meanings and commentate on modern society and sometimes predictions of future society. Cyberpunk was likely the partial inspiration (or anti-inspiration) for Solarpunk - an aesthetic that also aspires to cast a glance into the future, but does so with a much less nihilistic perspective and played a role in inspiring Vaporwave since both seem to share a seeming disdain for mainstream capitalism, but Vaporwave is more sarcastic and mocking compared to Cyberpunk, which is more open with its disdain for the corporate dystopia. In truth, most online aesthetics almost completely owe their entire existence to Cyberpunk and its rebelliousness to the status quo of the 1980s; everything from the Steampunk and Dieselpunk of yesteryear to any sort of micro-genres that will pop up in the future. '), ('Cyberspace Webrooms', 'Cyberspace Webrooms is an aesthetic that centers around Online Virtual Worlds from the 90s-2000s.

The term Cyber Stylin' can be used to generalize the common art styles during the time period, as well as virtual/pixel games, drawings, and illustrations meant for young girls at the time. Despite the name Cyber Stylin' being a blanket term, there are many different art styles within it, usually depending on the artist. "), ('Cybervillain', "Cybervillain is a character aesthetic that started in the late '90s, and rose to prominence throughout the '00s. The aesthetic has to do with shared traits amongst villains in cartoons that have a cybernetic or science fiction motif in the story. These villains typically are armored, employ technologically advanced weapons, and have aspirations to create/maintain an empire and/or commit some form of genocide. "), ('Dandy', 'The Dandy was a stereotype and trope prevalent during the late-18th and 19th centuries in France and Great Britain that represented middle-class men who were heavily concerned with their physical appareances and sense of fashion, pretended to lead aristocratic lifestyles and used refined language. Other stereotypical traits associated with Dandies is insatisfaction, boredom and rejecting the styles of the poorer people. Authors like Charles Baudelaire described Dandies as "men who elevated aesthetics to a religious level". The modern interpretation of Dandyism subculture as we see it today realistically originated in the 1790s, during the Revolutionary Period in Europe. Those who were described as Dandies or identified as such usually wore flamboyant clothing, similiar to those worn by French soldiers and the French high-class during the French Revolution. Some European artistic and cultural movements that fueled the prevalence of the Dandy stereotype include Aestheticism, Romanticism and Decadence. Today, much like Metrosexual, Dandy is considered an outdated term, because nowadays it\'s normalized for men to wear whatever clothing they\'d like without being judged, mocked or fetishized. '), ('Danish Pastel', 'Danish Pastel is an interior and graphic design aesthetic that became popular among young women in 2020, specifically on TikTok, Instagram, and Pinterest.

'), ('Dark Academia', 'Dark Academia is a popular (and the original) academic aesthetic that revolves around classic literature, the pursuit of self-discovery, and a general passion for knowledge and learning. Because this is an internet aesthetic, it largely entails sharing photographs, making outfits, and participating in certain hobbies through social media. As the internet aesthetic grew in the late 2010s and early 2020s, many book publishers capitalized on this aesthetic and used this phrase to create and advertise YA books, making this also a new fictional microgenre in its early stages. Dark Academia\'s visuals stem primarily from upper-class European cultures of the 19th century, Gothicism, and American Prep. The upper class of this time period emphasized a liberal education in which Latin, rhetoric, and classics were taught subjects. These are now seen as unusual and esoteric, creating an allure that presents schooling as not dreary or boring, but one that cultivates mystery, curiosity, and diligence that isn\'t commonly seen in contemporary schooling. Because of this allure of intelligence and mystery, being pretentious is celebrated within the Dark Academia community. Romanticizing education and moments in life related to university experiences is the core appeal of the aesthetic, with grandiose statements and wishes for success being common text post subjects. Other than the appreciation of learning, Dark Academia includes motifs of criminality and danger. Secret societies, cults and murder are common subjects within the aesthetic. Characters within the works of fiction associated with Dark Academia, specifically The Secret History and Kill Your Darlings, live decadent and self-destructive lifestyles involving drugs, moments of intense violence, and secrets. People who use this aesthetic are sometimes referred to as Dark Academics. However, "academic" typically refers to researchers and professors, while Dark Academia fans do not usually have recognized credentials or an academic background.

'), ('Dark Aero', "This article is part of a series on the Frutiger FamilyDark Aero, also known as Mata Nero or Frutiger Ego, is a sub-genre of Frutiger Aero popular from c. 2006-2015. Dark Aero uses a darker color palette contrasting the depth-filled colorful motifs characteristic of Frutiger Aero. This gave the aesthetic a more simplistic look, which lead to it still being used after Frutiger Aero's decline. Another one of Dark Aero's main signature characteristics is aero glass. Dark Aero can be described as the middle ground between Frutiger Aero and Skeuomorphism due to its Frutiger Aero-esque imagery combined with Skeuomorphism's color palette. Whilst Frutiger Aero was more commonly used for mass market and commercial products, Dark Aero focused on high-end and enterprise-oriented items and services. Dark Aero was also commonly used for for modern tech such as smartphones, computers, TVs, cars, etc. "), ('Darkcore', 'Darkcore is inspired by a set of dark rooms. This aesthetic can depict a black void or shadowy corners. Shadow figures are popular motifs of this aesthetic.

However, Dark Fantasy is unlike Fantasy in that it takes on a darker, more mysterious tone. A Dark Fantasy is a fairytale without a happy ending, or it may have a happy ending that is only achieved with a great cost. It is despairing, violent, or sometimes even gory, but still contains elements of elegance and intrigue. However, the term can also refer to a dark, almost vampiric style of fashion and general aesthetic mood, and a type of music as well. There may also be overlap with Spriggancore and Goblincore, as well as Dethereal. '), ('Dark Gatsby', "Dark Gatsby is a growing aesthetic diverging from the Roaring 20s and Flapper aesthetics that center around the vivacity of the 1920s Jazz Age. Dark Gatbsy owes its origins to the murkier underworld that helped the 1920s to roar (bootlegging, speakeasys, etc.), and is more visually diverse by including people of color, especially, African Americans --who created and popularized jazz-- and other underrepresented communities such as LGBTQIA. It also uses author F. Scott Fitzgerald's quintessential literary anti-hero Jay Gatsby from the American novel The Great Gatsby (1925) as the representative of this time. Jay Gatsby is a social climbing playboy of unknown origins who owes his wealth to shadowy gains. "), ('Dark Naturalism', 'Dark Naturalism is an aesthetic that mixes in the natural world, with its darker elements to create an atmosphere of a naturalist mystery, worship and beauty. '), ('Dark Nautical', 'Dark Nautical is a subgroup of the Nautical aesthetic. Though it shares a lot of imagery with both Nautical and Pirate aesthetics, it borrows much more from Cottagecore in its romanticized interpretation of western life by the sea. Whereas Nautical tends to focus on much higher economic class aesthetics and Pirate on chaotic, Dark Nautical centers around a more simple and harmonized life like Cottagecore. What makes Dark Nautical distinct from Cottagecore is its focus on the sea aspect of nature rather than forests or meadows. Dark Nautical is also characterized by a healthy dose of melancholy that does not exist in any of the previously mentioned aesthetics. The aesthetic involves being both aware of the vast ocean: what it is capable of, and what lies below, as well as being isolated for long periods of time. This awareness of the danger involved with the sea aligns Dark Nautical with such aesthetics as Witchcore and Forestpunk. Originally conceived earlier, it experienced a resurgence in early 2021 as sea shanties became more popular. Earlier versions of the aesthetic include such works as Moby Dick by Herman Melville and the works of H.P. Lovecraft. '), ('Dark Nymphet', 'Dark Nymphet is a photo based aesthetic that shows a picture of a pretty young girl, but unlike its counterpart Nymphet it has a darker and edgier tone. Dark nymphet focuses on nymphets who had bad experience in their life in various ways and choose to be gloomy unlike playful nymphets, or simply use darker colors than a typical nymphet. Eventually, this evolved into a whole Coquette substyle more commonly called Dark Coquette, with the trauma and other negative aspects removed and instead focusing on a darker version of typical Coquette fashion, although the Waif aesthetic contains some of the more negative aspects. There is a lot of Kinderwhore influence, and due to Lana Del Ray, there is a large Femme Fatale overlap as well especially in the later version of the aesthetic. Female Horror Game Protagonist aesthetic is inspired partially by Dark Coquette as well. Dark Coquette/Nymphet is commonly confused with Gloomy Coquette, but they are not the same. '), ('Dark Paradise', ' The Dark Paradise aesthetic focuses on images of serenity with a veil of darkness laid over it to rouse a sense of dark calmness. Dark Paradise revolves around visually dark photos, as if taken in the dark or in the late evening. This aesthetic is very versatile and can apply to other aesthetics due to the dark nature of common photos. The difference between this aesthetic and others is the feeling of inner peace and calmness. '), ('Dark Royaltycore', 'Dark Royaltycore is an aesthetic centered around the concept of fallen royalty. Focused on fallen royalty, the aesthetic merges opulence with decay. It is inspired by aesthetics like dark academia, royalcore, punk, lobotomy chic, old money and the visuals of Breadtube (see: Contrapoints, Philosophy Tube). The Dark Royaltycore community celebrates the fusion of opulence and decline, emphasizing narratives of fallen nobility, entwined with themes of incestuous relationships and mental struggles. This aesthetic embraces left-wing values and post-irony, highlighting the rebellious spirit of regal figures against conventional norms. It encourages intellectual engagement through influences from dark academia and Breadtube, while acknowledging the intricacy of taboo subjects. Dark Royaltycore also includes motifs of criminality and danger. Secret societies, cults and murder are common subjects within the aesthetic. Characters within the works of fiction associated with Dark Academia, specifically The Secret History and Kill Your Darlings, live decadent and self-destructive lifestyles involving drugs, moments of intense violence, and secrets.

'), ('Dau al Set', 'Dau al Set or Dau-al-Set (meaning "Seventh Face of the Die" in Catalan) was an Avant-garde artistic and philosophical movement that emerged in Catalonia (Spain) after World War II. It was founded by the poet and artist Joan Brossa in September of 1948 in Barcelona. This artistic movement was characterized by its interdisciplinary nature (such as poetry), and it was inspired by elements of Dadaism, Surrealism, Abstract Art, Symbolism and philosophical existentialism, and poetically depicted the nature of the conscious and subsconscious mind. The movement was \'rupturista\' (a Catalan & Spanish word to describe the belief that the system or the estabilished social norms should change) and was created to experiment with new forms of artistic expression and reject traditional art styles. '), ('Daydreampunk', 'Daydreampunk is an aesthetic inspired by Corporate Punk that specializes in daydream-themed visuals, along with a slight leaning to modern day punk. It was a common style in the early 2010s for tweens to children, often showing up in stores like Target, Walmart and Bath & Body works. Often referencing trends from that time, "dabbing" and internet slang, it quickly fell out of style, just recently picking up traction again. This aesthetic contains the suffix "-punk" because Daydreampunk is about expressing yourself and individual freedom. Daydreampunk could be considered a "kid-friendly" mixture of punk aesthetics and pastel goth aesthetics— or at least the impression of that. '), ('Dazecore', 'Dazecore is an aesthetic inspired by sleepless nights and the buzz of late night/early morning thoughts. It is very closely linked to Urbancore, Geek, and Dark Minimalism, heavily influenced by artists working in the early hours of the morning and students staying up late at night working on papers.

Classic expressions: "I don\'t care, I\'m dead inside", "1000-7". '), ('Deathrock', 'Deathrock is a subgenre of Goth that started in the 1980s. People who identify with the movement are called "Deathrockers". Considered a "missing link" between Goth and Punk, Deathrock is a fusion of the two movements. As an aesthetic, like Horror Punk, it embraces a gothic, horror, and cryptid influenced aesthetic juxtaposed with a camp version of American 50s suburban and urban idealization. Typically, it was influenced by film, particularly silent movies (like The Phantom of the Opera), B-movies (like Planet 9 From Outer Space), zombies (especially George Romeo’s movies), and Rocky Horror Picture Show. They were also heavily inspired by macabre musical artists like Alice Cooper. Deathrock was originally used as a term to refer to the American (specifically LA, California) 80s gothic scene. The movement was born out of Hardcore Punk and, much like British Goth, was a backlash against the stoic machismo of Punk. Key OG California Deathrock bands and artists included Castration Squad (arguably the first band), Patricia Morrison, Christian Death (particularly Rozz Williams and Gitane Demone), 45 Grave, True Sounds of Liberty (their second and third albums), Voodoo Church, Screams For Tina, Red Wedding, and Burning Image. Some proto-Hardcore Punk bands like The Bags and Nervous Gender were also influential. The genre‘s development was best displayed by the legendary LA alternative music show New Wave Theater and in magazines like Maximum Rock N’ Roll. College radio was also integral to the scene’s growth. To a smaller degree, New York had a Deathrock scene, which was fronted by bands like The Naked and The Dead and Of A Mesh. The original Deathrock movement lasted very briefly, as the LA contingent quickly disintegrated under the weight of drug culture and key artists in the scene moving away from taking inspiration in kitschy B-horror film imagery to an increasingly disturbing infatuation with occult ritualism and murder. Soon after, it became used as a broad reference to Punk-leaning Goth rock from around the world. In part this may have to do with the meeting of the 80s American and British Goth scenes, best illustrated in Patrica Morrison (who at that point all but abandoned the American scene) and Andrew Eldritch teaming up for The Sisters of Mercy’s Floodland. During the mid-80s, the Goth scene around the world was be influenced by America’s Deathrock scene, particularly in France, Germany, Spain, and Japan. '), ('Decopunk', "Decopunk is a recent subset of the punk sci-fi genres (specifically Dieselpunk), centered around the Art Deco and Streamline Moderne art styles that were popular during the Roaring 20s and stayed in fashion until sometime in the 1950s.

'), ('Deep Fried Meme', 'Deep Fried Memes (sometimes also spelt as Deepfried Memes) are a meme aesthetic that was prevalent from 2015 to 2019. The aesthetic focuses on applying a massive amount of filters and visual effects to images until they look hurtful to look at, as well as adding surrealistic, "dank" elements to the pictures; such as bright glowing red eyes, silly emojis, a red square with a B letter on it, and so on. Sometimes this meme aesthetic also uses elements of dark humor, such as racist jokes and slurs, which has led to controversy (See the Criticism section). The Deep Fried Meme trend first originated in Tumblr in 2015 and quickly gained popularity on sites like Reddit and YouTube, often being associated with the 2016 Band Kid stereotype. Deep Fried Memes are perhaps one of the most iconic examples of meta-ironic memes during the late 2010s, as they focus on the nature of memes and gaining meme status rather than the jokes themselves. '), ('Deep TikTok', 'Deep TikTok, also abbreviated as DeepTok, is a niche side of the TikTok community where people post videos with elements of surreal or bizarre humor. It originated as an experimental offshoot of the Alt TikTok community, and it reached peak popularity throughout 2020 and 2021.

The aesthetic originated on Tumblr from the mid 2010s. It co-existed and shared many visuals with the Morute community, except this one is entirely uninvolved in morbid themes. There is a lot of influence on the Babycore and Gloomy Coquette aesthetics. Rather, this aesthetic focuses on feelings of comfort, cuteness, and safety, the opposite of Morute which centers around trauma and mental illness. The name for this aesthetic was created for this wiki and only for documentation purposes. Originally, the aesthetic went without a name on Tumblr and could be found on individual blogs through tags such as #pink, #cute, #delicate (hence the name), etc. However, now it can be associated with the Coquette community especially since it has inspired the Dollette aesthetic. '), ('Denpa', 'Denpa (電波; literally meaning "electromagnetic wave") is a diverse Japanese fiction genre that centers around topics of delusion, asociality and a sense of losing connection with reality. It is also a musical genre closely related to J-core and Pop music, which may also be less commonly known as "Akiba-Pop" or "A-Pop". In Japan, the terms Denpa-kei (電波系) or Denpa-san (電波さん) particularly refer to people who are perceived as disconnected from reality and the people around them, or decide to live out vivid fantasies inside their dreams. The concept of Denpa shares many similiarities with how a major part of Japanese society saw the Otaku subculture during the 1990s-2000s, especially those who suffered from mental health disorders like MADD (Maladaptative Daydreaming Disorder), Schizophrenia or Paranoia. Denpa fiction was pioneered during these decades through the Visual Novel and Eroge video game genres; for example, the Denpa game Shizuku, released in 1996 for the PC-98 system, is often cited as the first visual novel.

De Stijl consisted of artists, architects and designers brought together by Theo van Doesburg. In a narrower sense, the term De Stijl is used to refer to works from 1917 to c.1924 founded in the Netherlands.

Digital Oddity often features art with a heavy amount of airbrush and gradient fill, with an artstyle very similar to Changed. '), ('Diner', 'Diner is an aesthetic focused around the architectural design of vintage American diners, usually from the 1950s. This type of restaurant was cemented into American culture with the rise of travel during this time period. Having a place to rest and eat hearty food was a boon for many people who started road-tripping. Today, many travelers still go to diners, but they have gradually declined because of the fast food industry, chain restaurants, and a desire to eat new foods. While the diner is a stop for travel, it also provides comfort to the locals and facilitates new encounters with kind strangers. Its owners and employees are typically the paragon of American homey stereotypes: hard-working blue collar people who want to make a living and enjoy life in their independent restaurant. Diners also evoke comfort in Americans because of the comfort food they serve. The diner is a significant place in fiction because of this. Media, especially centered around high school students or wanderers, typically uses diners as meeting places or encounters with new characters. There are mainly 2 types of ways this aesthetic is utilized. One is the traditional, and the other is modern. The traditional version uses warmer colors and generally sticks closer to historical accuracy, with little-to-no use of over-the-top tropes and kitsch. The modern version is as it sounds--a modern take on the 1950s diners, transforming it with brighter colors, sometimes neon and Glowwave. Many modern businesses also try to capitalize on the novelty and clutter the restaurant with paraphernalia that reminds the diners of the 1950s. '), ('Dionysism', 'Dionysism (pronounced die-oh-ny-sis-em) is an aesthetic based on the Grecian god Dionysus, his cult, and various other aspects of Grecian life and polytheism. As the god of wine, Dionysus is supposed to spread the knowledge of how to grow grape vines. In ancient Greece, wine was one of the few goods they could produce. Because of this, Dionysus was a major deity, and it was said that he was one of the twelve gods that lived upon Mount Olympus. Temples were erected in his honor and worship of him spread throughout the Greek poleis. Annual festivals called Dionysia were held in the honor of Dionysus and, of course, the purpose was to relax, feast, dance, and drink wine. Some dances in honor of him were performed on oiled wineskins, which were bags made out of animal skins that were filled with wine. Dionysus loved goats, donkeys, and tigers. Not only were those animals at the Dionysia, but their skins were also danced upon. When someone fell off the oiled wineskins, everyone cheered, laughed, and drank wine. In place of these outdated traditions, modern Dionysism may take place at various rowdy parties where alcohol is present and modern equivalences may be toga parties and dinner parties. '), ('Disco', "Disco is a musical genre and subculture that originated in the 1970s in the United States, in nightlife centers as diverse as New York City.

This later led to the creation of Sophisti-Pop, a hybrid of blue-eyed Soul & Synth-Pop seen in the New Romantic movement. It even influenced City Pop, which in turn led to the modern music of Future Funk.

Consequently, many Disco Polo cover arts and festival flyers use colorful and kitschy aesthetics that were popular from the 90s to the 2000s, including some visual similiarities with Frutiger Metro or Y2K Futurism. Originally known as Sidewalk Music (Polish: Muzyka Chodnikowa) or Backyard Music (Polish: Muzyka Podwórkowa), the term Disco Polo was coined in 1993 by singer-songriter Skręta as a tongue-in-cheek response to Italo Disco, but quickly became the most popular name for this genre.

Its popularity started declining in the 21st century, although it sometimes has resurgence in popularity. '), ('Dirty Girl', 'The Dirty Girl aesthetic (also known as the Messy Girl aesthetic) is a trend on TikTok for people who oppose skin care routines and minimalist fashion.

Note: Coquette is the most-used name for the fashion, but the wiki utilizes "coquette" as a disambiguation page for many aesthetics tagged as coquette in the past. While the aesthetic derived from the Nymphet community, it differed from the initial Nymphet aesthetic, which is heavily based on the Vintage Americana aesthetic and fashion of the various movie interpretations based on the book Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov; whereas Dollette, while still carrying on the Nymphet aesthetic, takes more inspiration from Delicate Sweet, Pink Parisian, and Balletcore. Dollette is still derived from Nymphet though and is a Coquette aesthetic, despite often being confused with any non-coquette Girly aesthetic. same love for Lana del Rey and the growing appreciation of feminine traits led to the rapid growth of this aesthetic.

While Grimoire, a shop, was influential in the creation of Dolly Kei, the fashion itself is not very brand focused. It is important to note that the term "Dolly Kei" is only used in reference to this particular fashion outside of Japan while locals use it to describe a doll-like aesthetic in general.

However, it also incorporates elements of Soft Grunge, with the laid-back attitude and admiration for the music and visual culture of that community. It also takes a lot of inspiration from Twilightcore, an aesthetic that is inspired by a gloomy interpretation of 2000s fashion. It contrasts the Uptown Girl aesthetic in that it is more casual and does not involve as many markers of wealth and hyper-femininity.

'), ('Dragoncore', 'Dragoncore is an aesthetic that rose to relevance together with other more mythical and nature-related aesthetics, during the 2010s.

They tend to have an apolitical mindset, and apart from that, they\'re usually associated to theft, crime and violence. Music connected to the Dresiarz subculture included Disco Polo and Disco during the 90s, although in the 21st century their music taste shifted towards Techno and House or Rap and Hip-Hop. '), ('Drugcore', "Drugcore is an aesthetic centered completely around the underground realm of drug usage and what some people will do to chase that specific high.

It is typically used in dark and grim Low Fantasy settings such as The Witcher and Berserk. The now commonplace setting of a dark miserable medieval world in a low fantasy dark setting is a key part of the modern aesthetic and is generally an adaptation of The High Tech Low Life philosophy of Cyberpunk for use in Fantasy settings which can be seen in books such as A Song of Ice and Fire, The Chronicles of Amber and The First Law Trilogy.

During the 17th century, driven by new freedom from Spanish Catholic rule, the Dutch Republic experienced a surge in economic and cultural prominence. An influx of trade boosted commerce, leading to the rise of a large middle and merchant class in the market for the proliferation of art that had cropped up in response to the burgeoning celebration of Dutch life and identity.

This aesthetic is primarily inspired by the African-American reclamation movement of West African spirituality, traditional African femininity, and connection to Earth as a whole.

The E-Girl aesthetic is expressed through assuming an ‘alt’ persona on trending social media platforms such as Tiktok with memes and video formulas. The E-Girl is the opposite counterpart to the Soft Girl (which influences the Kawaii Gamer/pastel E-Girl subtype). While the term E-girl first began to simply refer to chronically online women that grow an audience on social media, the stereotype is that these girls are trying to receive "clout" (internet fame) through being sexually attractive, and perhaps by posting "thirst-traps" (sexy photos) typically themed after hentai culture. There is significant overlap with the Dark subtype of the Babygirl aesthetic. These young women are mostly from the earlier half of Gen Z. During 2019, when the aesthetic became very popular, they were mostly in their mid-teens to early 20s. E-Girl fashion has developed significant overlap with the 2020s E-Kid aesthetic, though not all E-Girls fit into this newer iteration of the subculture and E-Girls often have more of a focus on sexuality. The classic E-Girl fashion appears very similar to Nu-Goth and Soft Grunge, but takes inspiration from various western and eastern alternative fashions(such as Goth Punk and Yami Kawaii) as the style evolves. Many modern versions of the style appear to be a patchwork of many popular alternative fashion genres. '), ('Electropop 08', 'Electropop 08, also known as Recession Pop, is an aesthetic named after the late 2000s Electropop explosion that dominated the airwaves.

The term Electro-Ecletic is created for the purpose of this Wiki. The style is commonly associated with Futurism and the Avant Garde umbrella. It can be seen in, but not limited to music, videos, art projects, and fashion. While bearing similarities to Frutiger Aero, Retro-Futurism, and Y2K Futurism, Electro-Eclecticism stands on its own as a distinct aesthetic. '), ('Electro Swing', 'Electro Swing, sometimes also called Swing House, is a musical genre which combines vintage or modern Swing with Jazz, House, Hip-Hop, and EDM. This aesthetic centers heavily on music. Overall, electro swing is to do with partying and having a good time. It often gives off an atmosphere of positivity and joy. Electro swing music is often remixed from the 1920s - 50s, which can cause the aesthetic to fall into the trope of romanticizing that era, and giving it a modern touch without putting the beautiful old-fashioned vibe away. It is especially important to remember that and appreciate that swing music is a form of Jazz, meaning many, if not most or all elements of swing are inspired by Black culture. '), ('Elizabethan England', 'Elizabethian England is an aesthetic that centers around the Elizabethan Era (1558-1603), other nomenclature to describe this period is Tudor Aesthetic from 1485 to 1603 when the house of Tudor reigned in England, with six monarchs Henry VII, Henry VIII, Edward VI, Lady Jane Gray, Mary I and Elizabeth I The Elizabethan Era was also a period of art including sculptures, architecture, paintings, decorative arts (such as ceramics), etc The Aesthetics was created during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, also called "The Virgin Queen", who during her reign made many investments in the arts, sciences and culture of England, beginning a "english renaissance" '), ('ElsaGate', "ElsaGate (also referred to as Kids’ Content Farms) is a sub-aesthetic of Kidcore that focuses on pop culture characters on social media, but often places them in violent, sexual, or disgusting situations and environments.

"), ('Emo', 'Emo is a subculture that originally branched off the Hardcore Punk scene, characterized by Hardcore music with introspective lyrics and a distinctive fashion style featuring dark clothing, piercings, and expressive hairstyles.

It should not be confused with Writer Academia, although some English majors are writers. '), ('Equestrian', 'Equestrian is an aesthetic that relates to the art of horseback riding and horses in general. It features motifs related to horses like saddles, horseshoes and riding on horseback. Although equestrians are often ignorantly called "Horse Girls", the aesthetic of being an equestrian is very different.

An equestrian, on the other hand, can be a person of any gender who appreciates horses and the art of riding. '), ('Ero-Guro', 'Ero-Guro (エログロ), short for "erotic grotesque nonsense", is a Japanese art movement and literary genre that focuses on disturbing imagery combined with topics of sexual/romantic and surreal ambients. The genre itself surged in the 1920s as a reaction towards the taboo topics of Japanese society; combining the elements of eroticism (ero) with grotesque imagery (guro). Ero-Guro art can be divided in various styles; some artworks are more similiar to Japanese folk art, while some have more in common with modern anime and manga, and some artworks are more shocking than others. This art movement has inspired various other aesthetics, including Angura and partially Breakcore. '), ('Erokawa', 'Erokawa (エロカワ) is a Japanese aesthetic that is contrasts the popular kawaii trends by drawing notions of the western concept of sexiness, particularly lingerie. The term, coined in 2005, is a fusion of ero (shortened from the English word "erotic", which has negative connotations in Japanese culture) and the lighter kawaii, meaning "cute". Unlike previous erotic trends in Japan, it was created by women for women and gave a sense of empowerment as Japanese women were able to claim ownership over their sexuality in a way that catered to female tastes rather than male sexual desire. The babygirl aesthetic is highly inspired by erokawa. Nowadays, the term is mostly associated with adult content aimed at women that is heavily inspired by kawaii culture. '), ('Eshay', 'Eshay is a slang expression associated with an Australian urban youth subculture. The term can refer to individuals within the subculture, or to the subculture itself. The word "eshay" apparently derives from the Pig Latin language/argot. The term "adlay" (/ˈædleɪ/), Pig Latin for "lad," refers to the same subculture. They are often considered stereotypically hypermasculine and inclined to crime and violence. They may be affiliated with other local youths from the same area, hang out in groups, use slang derived from Pig Latin, wear sportswear, listen to drill music, and engage in intimidating and anti-social behaviour often in trainstations, particulary in Melbourne. '), ('Ethereal', 'Ethereal is an aesthetic based around the feeling of being extremely delicate and light in a way that seems to be not of this world. It is typically used in reference to Disney or Barbie princess movies and other fantasy films that are completely without irony in their dreamy romanticism.

It is a generalization of film imagery that includes depictions of royalty (often princes and princesses), classical dancers, sweeping ballrooms, colorful gardens, pixie dust, fairies, angels, and the beauty of true love. There is a lot of overlap with Cottagecore and Royalcore. Ethereal can be seen as an umbrella term for different but similar aesthetics such as Angelcore, Auroracore, Fairycore, Snowdrop, Mermaidcore, Unicorncore, Fairytale, Dreamy, Dethereal, and more. '), ('Ethno-Chic', 'Ethno-Chic is an aesthetic, fashion style and room decoration style that blends Chic elements with Folk elements from various cultures and historical eras. Being related to the more recent Bohemian style, it creates a mixture of ethnic patterns, textures, raw materials and various natural colours and incorporates them into modern Chic fashion. It\'s meant to create a sense of harmony and cultural diversity. An important part of the Ethno-Chic style is "storytelling" through objects and visuals, as the elements used often carry an important cultural meaning. Generally, Ethno-Chic can take inspiration from the visual elements of any culture, however cultures deemed "exotic" are the most commonly used. Because of this, this aesthetic mainly takes inspiration from African countries and Indigenous American communities, as well as India. However, it\'s important to note that Ethno-Chic does not authentically represent the cultures it takes inspiration from; it is supossed to be a multicultural aesthetic rather than a representation of the actual thing. '), ('Europunk', 'Europunk (also known as Ruritaniancore or Euro-fiction) is an aesthetic based on non-existent, fictitious or uchronic European countries, as well as a distorted European vision that takes on different directions (alternative history).

'), ('Expressionism', 'Expressionism is a modernist movement, initially in poetry and painting, originating in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century. Expressionist artists have sought to express the meaning of emotional experience rather than physical reality. Its typical trait is to present the world solely from a subjective perspective, distorting it radically for emotional effect in order to evoke moods or ideas. '), ('Fairy Academia', "Note: This was a personal aesthetic, but because this was created before the ban on personal aesthetics was in place, many content creators used this page for inspiration, making this page necessary.Fairy Academia is a feminine, otherworldly offshoot of Dark Academia, inspired by the popular children's novels and illustrations from the 19th and 20th centuries as well as the general themes and visuals of Victorian and Edwardian childhood. The main inspiration comes from the concept or belief in English/Western European folklore, particularly fairies and their relationship to children. Key inspirations of the aesthetic are derived from Cicely Mary Barker's flower fairy illustrations, which remain popular with modern children because of picture books like Fairyopolis or with collectors of Barker prints/novelty home ware. Other artists that depict similar fairies are also included, as well as depictions of the fairies from the works of William Shakespeare, such as Titania, Oberon, and the fairy kingdom in A Midsummer Night's Dream or Ariel in The Tempest. Fairy academics enjoy learning and education, as well as trickery and scheming - as in the 1917 Cottingley Fairy hoax, where two young girls used trick photography to con the populace into thinking there were real fairies in their garden. "), ('Fairycore', 'Fairycore, also known as Fairy Folk, is an Ethereal aesthetic that centres predominantly around fairy (alternatively spelled faerie) and elf mythology. Visuals include nature, soft pastels, butterflies, magic, flowers, soft animals like bunnies, and the vibe of springtime. Fairycore usually features feminine visuals and styles, and the more masculine equivalent/subtype is Elfcore( as traditionally, elf is a masculine term and fairy is the feminine term). Any and all fey-like creatures from mythology around the world are included. This ranges as far and wide as Celtic, Scottish, Nordic, German, French, Native American, Japanese, Chinese, etc. It includes the typical Fae and fairies (usually from Scottish Seelie and Unseelie) as well as various kinds of elves, nymphs, shapeshifters (like swan maidens/men), and various other creatures. It is most similar to Cottagecore, Pixiecore, and Goblincore. The term was coined by an unknown Tumblr user. The aesthetic is popular with fairykin, people who incorporate the concept of fairies into their personal identity. Although it is similar to many nature based aesthetics, some say it is the feminine equivalent to Goblincore. This is debatable, because fairycore focuses on the beauty of nature, such as flowers, fairies, dresses, and femininity, while Goblincore is more based on appreciating the not so pretty parts of nature, like mushrooms, bugs, dirt, etc. '), ('Fairy Grunge', 'Fairy Grunge is a mix of the Fairycore and Grunge aesthetics. This aesthetic was popularized predominantly by creators on TikTok and other social media platforms, but has strong roots in early 2000s YA fairy fandom (particularly the works of Holly Black). Given the goals and themes of Fairy Grunge, it could be viewed as a natural evolution of the Kinderwhore aesthetic (which also has deep ties with Grunge), but goes for more of an ethereal and Hot Topic-influenced twist. '), ('Fairy Kei', 'Fairy Kei (フェアリー系) is a Japanese fashion based on children\'s popculture from the 80s. As the name suggests, it is characterized by a pastel color palette as well as a fluffy or floaty appearance. When not refering to the fashion on its own, the term "fancy" (ファンシー) is commonly used within Japan to describe its nostalgic aesthetic. '), ('Fairy Tale', 'Fairytale is an instance of a folklore genre that takes the form of a short story. Such stories typically feature mythical, and often magical, entities, such as dwarfs, dragons, elves, fairies, giants, gnomes, goblins, griffins, mermaids, talking animals, trolls, unicorns, or witches, and usually magic or enchantments. Often the setting is inspired by the Medievel era. In most cultures, there is no clear line separating myth from folk or fairy tale; all these together form the literature of preliterate societies. Fairy tales may be distinguished from other folk narratives such as legends (which generally involve belief in the veracity of the events described) and explicit moral tales, including beast fables. The fairytale aesthetic can be seen as a subtype of both Fantasy and Ethereal. Visuals may have a distinct crossover with Fairycore, Cottagecore, Royalcore, and sometimes Mermaidcore. '), ('Fanfare', 'Fanfare is an aesthetic surrounding circuses and carnivals, temporary events that involve spectacle, fun, and excitement because of their rarity, various rides and attractions, and interesting, sometimes mysterious people that operate the circus/carnival. Western culture has tropified imagery associated with circuses because of media and the traditions associated with going to these events. These spectacles tend to be seen as outdated forms of entertainment with a folkish, almost tacky connotation. This is due to the fact that circuses were popular during the early to mid 20th century. Tradition has kept the visual imagery, with all of the events established during the Victorian era in P.T. Barnum\'s circuses. Past circus practices are also now seen as antiquated and abusive; lion-taming, seal clowns, and freak shows leaves a bad taste on modern audiences. They also are not as easily amused by clowns, "kiddie" rides, and live events, leading to decline. Circuses may also have elements of fantasy. In fiction, it is not uncommon to have a circus be hiding the fact that the performers have actual magic powers that allow them to perform their stunts. So, the aesthetic can gain some mystique and elegance, with jewel-toned costumes, charismatic and flirtatious personalities, and an attractive form of danger. Carnivals and circuses are two distinct types of spectacles, but have been associated with each other because they often overlap. Circuses put out rides in order to attract a wider audience and carnivals typically have stage shows that are the same as circus acts. Their temporary nature also forces them to use the same kinds of stands and tents as each other, and they also use the same type of imagery to bring excitement. Note that this aesthetic excludes amusement parks, water parks, and magic shows. Those are more permanent locations and have aesthetics that are more refined, put-together, and do not have the same visual tropes as fanfare. '), ('Fantasy', 'Fantasy is a genre of fiction set in a fictional universe, often inspired by real world myth and folklore. Its roots are in oral traditions, which then became fantasy literature and drama. Fantasy often makes an appearance as epic fantasy inspired by the middle ages in Europe. However, fantasy can be inspired by various times and places. The fantasy aesthetic crosses over with the Dragoncore, Royalcore/Knightcore, Wizardcore, and others such as Cottagecore depending on the subtype. '), ('Fantasy Astronomy', "Fantasy Astronomy centers around the depiction of the study of astronomy and astrology in fictional fantasy settings. These visuals are based on astronomers during the Scientific Revolution (16th-17th centuries) but are included in stories with magic systems and feudal politics, with a setting, usually an observatory that has whimsical architecture and scholarly characters. This aesthetic often overlaps with Wizardcore. The astronomy depicted in the fictional situations and aesthetic pictures is much simpler and magical than actual astronomy, as mapping constellations, making observations through a telescope, astrology, divination, and how the stars relate to the fictional world's magic system are common areas of study for the character or visual design. "), ('FantasY2K', "FantasY2K is an aesthetic that takes elements of Medieval Fantasy aesthetics and reinterprets them to conform to the fashion trends of the 2000s. The balance of these clashing styles can vary from haute couture runway looks with vaguely fantastical themes, to film and TV costumes that are passable as loosely historical, but with definite anachronisms such as modern hairstyles, makeup and silhouettes. The aesthetic takes an unapologetically kitsch approach in its disregard for historical accuracy in favor of contemporary trends. For this reason, it is often adopted with self-aware irony, particularly in satirical media such as A Knight's Tale or Ella Enchanted. FantasY2K is very distinct from other fantasy inspired aesthetics such as Fairy Grunge and Mythpunk, due to its far brighter colour palette and its whimsical, often camp, sensibilities. Although it shares some motifs with Fairycore, it is differentiated by its more direct appropriation of Y2K aesthetics and a more significant Medieval influence. "), ("Farmer's Daughter", "Farmer's Daughter is a Nymphet variation on the Soft Country aesthetic where the visuals revolve around the community-created character of a farmer's daughter, a girl living in rural America farmland and is hyper-feminine and promiscuous. This aesthetic romanticizes the idea of a farm girl through the lens of teenaged girls on Tiktok and Pinterest, as opposed to the actual aesthetic preferences and reality of women in rural America, which is better seen on the page Country. Buckle Bunny is another Coquette subtype that is most similar to Farmer’s Daughter. "), ('Fauvism', 'Fauvism was an art movement that originated in the early 1900s in France. The movement clearly broke from Impressionism, as well as other traditional techniques, with its use of bold brushstrokes and vibrant colors. Fauvism was heavily inspired by van Gogh, Paul Gauguin, Georges Seurat, and Paul Cézanne; it was led by Henri Matisse and André Derain.'), ('Female Horror Game Protagonist Fashion', 'Female Horror Game Protagonist Fashion is a TikTok trend wherein young women create outfits inspired by Japanese horror video game protagonists, specifically from the Fatal Frame series. The fashion is largely built upon the concurrent social media youth fashion trend, Coquette, specifically the Dark Coquette subtype, as well as having Grunge influences. It largely depends on the use of dark-colored pieces from hyper-feminine brands from Japan and generous accessories. '), ('Femboy', 'Femboy (among many other similar terms) is a self-identifier for a man or boy expressing himself in a fashion perceived to be feminine or otherwise “soft”. The key defining feature is contrasting gender signifiers.

Individuals who identify as femboys may be of any sexuality. '), ('Femcel Weeaboo', 'Femcel Weeaboo is an aesthetic primarily made by and/or depicts women who are an overlap between femcels and weeaboos and identify as such. These young women use anime and manga as escapism from their lives, typically as mentally ill NEETs with no real life social circle or romantic partner, although this is through an internet persona rather than necessarily having to actually take place in reality. The majority of femcel weeaboos mostly use Tumblr and Twitter, where they post photos of Japanese media and memes (typically centered around mental illness and existential dread). Those who participate in the Femcel Weeaboo subculture usually share a very specific taste in anime and music; they often identify with and relate to fictional characters from anime shows and video games that have "messed up" backgrounds or characters that exhibit traits of mental disorders, including but not limited to: Serial Experiments Lain, Needy Streamer Overload, Evangelion, WataMote, Puella Magi Madoka Magica, etc. As for the musical aspect, some genres widely listened to by the Femcel Weeaboo community are Indie Rock, Breakcore, and Lolicore. '), ('Femme Fatale', ' A Femme Fatale is a mysterious, intelligent, beautiful, and seductive woman whose charms ensnare anyone who meets her, often leading them into deadly traps and webs of crime. People who adhere to the Femme Fatale aesthetic try their best to embody the traits of the classic femme fatale archetype, which leads to a lot of crossover with the Baddie aesthetic; one of the key differences between the two is the Femme Fatale has an air of mystery and elegance to her, whereas the Baddie follows a more "what you see is what you get" philosophy (combining the two leads to the Cherry Emoji Twitter aesthetic). Femme Fatale also influences Dark Coquette, with the latter having more of a youthful Nymphet vibe to it.

It surged as a reaction against the prevalence of Abstract Art, as well as other popular contemporary art movements like Nouveau Réalisme and Pop Art. The artists of the Figuration Narrative movement sought to create a type of art that incorporated influence from New Figuration and contradicted Abstraction by managing to tell a story through their artworks; hence why it was named "narrative figuration" by the French art critic Gérald Gassiot-Talabot in 1962. Outside France, Figuration Narrative also holded popularity among Spanish artists during the 1970s, as means to combat censorship through art.

'), ('Foodie', 'Foodie is a gourmet or a person who has an ardent/refined interest in food and alcoholic beverages. It involves seeking new food experiences as a hobby rather than simply eating out of convenience or hunger.

'), ('Forestpunk', "Forestpunk is an aesthetic that is in the naturecore family. It is similar to cottagecore in its high regard for nature and mutual support. However, forestpunk is less restrictive of technology, particularly solar-powered items. Forestpunk also diverges from other related aesthetics in its inspiration & timeframe. Where Cottagecore is derived from a romanticization of a European rural lifestyle, forestpunk-like styles have and still are present in several cultures around the world. (Examples include the Nordic, Uralic, Roma, Celtic, Siberian, Austronesian, Subsaharan, Aborigine, and Native American peoples.) As long as there's a forest element to it, you've spotted a good inspiration, be it clothing or farming. While the examples mentioned earlier are good guides, take a look at the image on the right for more modern inspiration. For example, a cabin in the middle of the woods, surrounded by vines & trees, living off rainwater & produce, feeding toads & deer while collecting their bones for decoration. Or, an apartment with solar panels with plants dotting the walls, rocks & buttermoths moving around, buying locally & dressed in greens & light browns. Goals are not only flexible, but each person makes their own based on acting feral and surviving in the wild. There is some overlap with Cryptidcore due to the more feral nature of the aesthetic, Mossy for obvious reasons, and Goblincore due to the recollection of mosses, rocks, and plants used for decoration (in non-harmful ways to the environment) being a widespread practice.

This aesthetic was originally unnamed at the time, being more associated with specific styles (e.g., Windows Aero, iOS\'s skeuomorphic icons, and the visuals of Mirror\'s Edge and Spore) rather than a broader aesthetic. Some referred to it as "Web 2.0 Gloss" during the time when the aesthetic was mainstream, however it was mostly used as an adjective to describe the glossy elements of Frutiger Aero rather than the aesthetic as a whole. The term "Frutiger Aero" was coined in 2017 by Sofi Lee of the Consumer Aesthetics Research Institute and went viral in 2022, leading to renewed interest in the aesthetic. Frutiger Aero contains many sub-aesthetics/related aesthetics; these include, but are not limited to: Frutiger Metro, Technozen, Frutiger Eco, and Helvetica Aqua Aero.

Frutiger Eco is separated from these aesthetics as it more falls in-line with the visuals and history and of Frutiger Aero. Frutiger Eco\'s name comes from its father aesthetic, Frutiger Aero, and the prefix (not used as a prefix in this context) "eco", meaning ecology or the environment.

It combines flat, minimalist graphics with a maximalist design philosophy, typically catering to a pre-teen/teenage demographic. Frutiger Metro shares a lot of similarities with Frutiger Aero and other aesthetics of the time; unlike Frutiger Aero which has a large focus on detailed glossy 3D designs, Frutiger Metro is flat. Frutiger Metro\'s name is derived from it\'s cousin-aesthetic, "Frutiger" Aero, which it bears a heavy resemblance to; the second part of it\'s name, "Metro", is named after the Metro design language created by Microsoft which was utilised in Windows 8 (Frutiger Metro\'s most prominent appearance). This is similar to Frutiger Aero being named after Windows Aero (featured in Windows 7).

How these furry characters are depicted can differ vastly from artist to artist. Nonetheless, in general, most furry artists have a preference for bright, happy colours, often with pastel tones. In many OCs (especially older ones made pre-2010), tacky, kitschy colour combinations are seen (such as a wolf character with grey body, neon blue snout, eyes and hair, plus bright pink stripes on their body). Although this trend seems to have diminished somewhat, the preference for bright, happy colours remains, which is unsurprising, considering how many furry characters are - directly or indirectly - inspired by cartoons. Therefore, the furry fandom is often close to Kidcore. Obviously, not all furry artists have this aesthetic, and in principle virtually any aesthetic may be combined with a furry character. '), ('Future Funk', ' Once seen as Vaporwave\'s happy-go-lucky sibling, Future Funk (also known as Vaporboogie) is a musical genre and aesthetic that takes the sampling aspect of Vaporwave, but rather than try to turn it into a decayed version of what it once was to mock the hollowness of capitalism at the time, Future Funk takes samples from 1970s and 1980s disco tracks and cut them in a way to make a completely new, groovy track for the people to enjoy, by cutting the "extra fluff" and focusing on the part of pop songs most people tend to remember. The Future Funk sound tends to draw a lot of inspiration from French House and Synth Funk and makes new, fun, poppy music. The aesthetics from Future Funk have a strong crossover with Animecore, taking lots of inspiration from anime from the 70\'s, 80\'s, and 90\'s (Sailor Moon and Lum from Urusei Yatsura, in particular, are very popular to use in Future Funk, making them unofficial mascots for the genre). However, in recent years, Future Funk has grown into being a unique aesthetic in its own right, embracing more Kawaii and City Pop elements than before, but still maintaining the same happy-go-lucky nature that made Future Funk popular in the 2010s.

Many memes and remixes related to the subculture feature exaggerated movements and suggestive poses that jokingly explore masculinity and sexuality.

The genre arose around the mid-1980s in the United States at the hands of rappers like Schoolly D and Ice-T, and was popularized in the latter part of the 1980s by groups like N.W.A. Thanks to the media attraction that Ice-T and N.W.A achieved between the late eighties and early nineties in their country, Gangsta Rap went on to become the most commercially lucrative subgenre of hip hop. Some gangsta rappers in the United States have been associated outside the music circuit with real gangsters, affirming the existence of ties to gangs such as the Bloods or the Crips. Sometimes the aesthetic is banned at bars and venues with rules like no white t-shirts or baggy clothing. The offical reasoning is usually that this style is commonly worn by gangs, but this could also lead to discrimination (or intentionally be racist) as many black people are part of the aesthetic without actually being gangsters. "), ('Gardencore', 'Gardencore is a subgenre of Bloomcore and a nature-based aesthetic that revolves around gardens, gardening, homegrown goods, and upcycled junk within the garden. While many of the motifs of Gardencore overlap with Bloomcore, its key differentiations lie in its focus on down-to-earth, rustic, and practical elements, in contrast to the softer, ethereal, and more delicate themes of the latter. Therefore, at times, it aligns stronger with other nature-related aesthetics like Goblincore, Green Academia, and Soggy. Gardencore places emphasis on community and eco-consciousness, and the use of salvaged items is a common motif. In addition to more common types of gardens like veggie patches, wildlife gardens, botanical gardens, and greenhouses, Gardencore is inclusive to non-traditional forms of gardens, such as terrariums, container gardens, and hanging gardens--although it primarily focuses on gardens grown at home or among members of a local community. It shares common elements with Groundcore, Fairycore, and even Salvagepunk in its appreciation and use of miniature and/or handcrafted items. However, it is not the primary focus of Gardencore, nor is it the primary grounds that would constitute a piece of media as such, but these types of things are commonly found within gardens all over the world.

Although the exact origin of the face is unknown, the aesthetic associated with the Gesugao face was developed during the late 2010s, with many Manga Music Videos (MMVs) featuring these types of faces and visuals. It especially gained meme status in 2018 and 2019, when the YouTuber Ms. Pantsu uploaded an AMV for the song "U Got That" by Halogen. The video itself depicted various manga panels from the Kantai Collection series, which featured Ship Girl characters doing Gesugao faces. The aesthetic used in the video quickly became popular due to the cliché nature of the facial expressions, as well as its other intimidating visuals.

The Girl Crush concept has seen and been experimented with variety of styles in the past decades, from its based traditional tomboy fashions or/and rebel swagger, to some groups coming along creating a new lane for a more hyper feminine and female empowering touch made iconic by BLACKPINK and their sweet touch of elegance, and to others bringing sexiness and sex appeal to the concept via the use to be popular Sexy Concept, which some group use to showcase the crossover of both concepts together.

'), ('GiscardPunk', "GiscardPunk (also spelled Giscardpunk) is a term coined by artist, developer and art & design teacher Florent Deloison to describe a France-centric visual aesthetic movement and music genre with close ties to Cassette Futurism and Retro-Futurism. It is a broadly encompassing and (sometimes satirical) celebration of the modernist movement (including technology, consumer goods, architecture, fashion and graphic design) as manifested specifically in France during the presidency of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing (1974-1981), though it also extends to the 1960s and to the end of the 1980s despite Giscard not being president during these years. Put simply, GiscardPunk can be seen as a French offshoot of wider nostalgia for this time period with a particular focus on modernism and the contemporary concept of 'progress' in general. That said, GiscardPunk is also intrinsically linked to a satirical alternate-history narrative (also created by Deloison) in which, unlike in our own timeline, Giscard was re-elected as president of France in 1981. This uchronia is not intended to be taken seriously and is both dystopian and irrational by nature. It is therefore a source of humorous content and memes for its fans, though it must be stressed that a large portion of GiscardPunk content is a genuine expression of admiration and nostalgia for the time period rather than for the alternate timeline and that media associated with GiscardPunk does not necessarily have to correspond with lore. Essentially, both admiration for the era and the alternate-history lore run alongside each other as two parts of the GiscardPunk genre and can either be engaged separately or simultaneously by its fans, potentially on an interchangeable basis.

Other British glam rock artists include David Bowie, Mott the Hoople, Sweet, Slade, Mud, Roxy Music and Gary Glitter. Those not central to the genre, such as Elton John, Rod Stewart and Queen, also adopted glam styles. There was a similar scene in the United States, with Alice Cooper, Kiss, The Tubes, Brownsville Station, and Lou Reed being the most popular American exponents of the style. Other American glam artists include the New York Dolls, Sparks, Suzi Quatro, Iggy Pop, Zolar X, The Runaways, Cherry Vanilla, The Magic Tramps, Ruby and the Rednecks, and Jobriath - many of these acts constituted the "glam punk" style, a movement that was most prominent in New York City, Los Angeles, and the Northeastern United States.

Recently, some Linux distros have also been implementing this design; iOS/macOS have been the first using it since 2013.

In the 1950s and 1960s, these youths were also known as "hoods". This may be due to the fact that the style was more popular in poor neighborhoods that had higher crime rates than upper-class neighborhoods. The name "greaser" came from their greased-back hairstyle, which involved combing back hair using hair wax, hair gel, creams, tonics or pomade. The term "greaser" reappeared in later decades as part of a revival of 1950s popular culture. One of the first manifestations of this revival was a 1971 American 7 Up television commercial that featured a 1950s greaser saying "Hey remember me? I\'m the teen angel." The music act Sha Na Na also played a major role in the revival. Although the greaser subculture was largely a North American youth phenomenon, there were similar subcultures that sprouted up in the United Kingdom, Australia, Italy, Japan, France, Sweden, Germany, New Zealand and South Africa, due to the influence of American culture and media.

Bugs and Insects, while not necessarily being the main focus of Groundcore (see: Bugcore), do play a big role in real-world depictions of the aesthetic by bringing it to life and allowing it to somewhat branch out in other directions and expand upon itself in many different ways, such as in movies or media, exploring the concept of a bug's adventures or day-to-day life. Note that while Groundcore is, as said above, often depicted to heavily lean towards a warm/summery nature feel, other themes and elements are not to be entirely excluded from the aesthetic, at times even presenting an additional subsection of it altogether, (i.e., a currently undefined but perfectly valid concept of 'winter-themed Groundcore' with its own set of visuals).Due to this, Groundcore may be better thought of as a somewhat broad umbrella term, which is mostly up to the viewer's interpretation, rather than a strictly defined aesthetic.

'), ('Gyaru', 'Gyaru (ギャル, Gal) is a Japanese subculture that was born as a rebellion against the traditional Asian beauty standards of being pale and showing little skin.

Many practicing occultists, pagans, and witches could be a fan of this aesthetic as they adopt Greek deities as their patron and matrons gods and goddesses, often involving them in their everyday lives. This can range from creating altars to communicating to them through divination. Learning about deities\' associations, preferences, and mythos are key to connecting and working with them.

While hip-hop has evolved considerably away from the streets of the Bronx, it has become perhaps the biggest genre of music in the world, welcoming any and all into its fold if they have the skills to stand out, even with the much-maligned "Mumble Rap" and "Trap" that is currently popular right now, the spirit of DIY that permeates Hip-Hop is alive and well in the new generation.

However, rather than alternative subcultures which are visually and philosophically a rejection of majority trends (such as Punk), Hipsters seek to be more familiar with the mainstream and deviate it out of a search for uniqueness while still participating within the mainstream.

'), ('Historical Americana', ' Historical Americana is an umbrella aesthetic based on the history of the United States pre-WWI, from the start of the colonies in the 16-17th century to the 1890s. There are multiple periods, each with different philosophies, artistic values, and notable people, which are described in the index. While these eras are distinct, contemporary Americans view these time periods as generally "historical," with it being hard to relate to these peoples. They are made into heroes, inspirations, and points of interest, especially the Founding Fathers of the nation. The aesthetic is used to connect modern Americans with the people of the past in a desire to create national culture, connect with American values, and interest people in American history. Values do change throughout history, but there are motifs that are consistent in telling "the American story." There is a constant struggle in establishing democracy, with historical periods generally characterized as different battles, such as creating it in the Revolutionary era and maintaining the Constitution in the Civil War era. Americans take great pride in their democratic history and the aesthetic functions as an artistic way to present that narrative and assert that there are no kings or great authorities like with France\'s Rococo. Another motif is the simultaneous fear and romanticization of nature. Forests, mountains, and rivers feature prominently in American art and it evokes adventure, mystery, and the supernatural in Romantic period literature and the journey of Louis and Clark. Later, n Manifest Destiny, nature also came to symbolize opportunity, destiny, and the heroism of the American people.

This version of Skeuomorphism, however, is more watered down and flatter. Holo\'s backgrounds can be described as dark, simplistic yet calming due to its "cold" color palette; the most common colors are black, blue, indigo, violet, cyan, and purple.

Sometimes, if paired with lyrics or quotes, they are usually from artists such as Lana del Rey, Marina and the Diamonds, The Arctic Monkeys, Melanie Martinez, Billie Eilish, and Lorde. These artists tend to sing about their current situation and emotions, creating a zone of in the now, absorbed in the now. They talk very poetically, describing experiences quite deeply and eclectically. Some examples are moments when you are loving someone, how disastrous and messy they are, and what they want to or are doing right now. The font is also not attention-grabbing, but a simple cute font, whereas the soothing shiny iridescence is intended to be the real attention grabber.

The term "Hollywood Regency" is thought to have been coined by the professional interior designer Dorothy Draper sometime during the decade of the 1920s, and she was one of the many pioneers of this design style along with William Haines. Dorothy Draper was particularly well known for her use of black and white tiles on the floor, and scrollworks and plasterworks inspired by the Rococo and Baroque art movements, although the creators of the Hollywood Regency style also sought to contradict both by being more maximalistic, tropical and less repetitive. The author Rochelle Greayer described the Hollywood Regency style as: "Hollywood Regency is glitz and glamour covered in lacquer, chrome, and mirrored finishes. Every detail is meant to convey luxury and there is always the feeling that people should look good in the design— particularly if they are wearing satin bathrobes and sipping a cocktail." ― Rochelle Greayer'), ('Home 2K', 'Home 2K, also known as Gen-X Home, is an interior design aesthetic that rose to prominence in the mid 2000s.

It is similar to Cottagecore in that rural agricultural imagery and values are emphasized, but the visuals are streamlined to create a color palette of mostly pale yellows and browns and a heavy focus on honey, bees, and anything apiary-related. Bees, honey, and flowers are featured frequently in Honeycore visuals. Honeycore philosophy emphasizes agriculture and conservation of bees.

Cuddon defined the horror story as "a piece of fiction in prose of variable length which shocks, or even frightens the reader, or perhaps induces a feeling of repulsion or loathing". It creates an eerie and frightening atmosphere. Horror is frequently supernatural, though it might be non-supernatural. Often the central menace of a work of horror fiction can be interpreted as a metaphor for the larger fears of a society. As the entire point of Horror is to frighten the audience, Horror is often considered an extremely personal and diverse genre, as it depends on the fears and distastes of the viewer. There are many subgenres of Horror that focus in specific aesthetics and styles, including but not limited to Analog Horror, B-Movie Horror, Catholic Horror, Digital Horror, Gross-Out Horror, etc. '), ('Horror Academia', 'Horror Academia is a subgenre of academia that focuses thematically on the overwhelming amount of knowledge in the world. Visually, it takes horror—especially cosmic or Lovecraftian horror—and applies it to academia, research, and learning. It takes inspiration from the exhaustion of being a student or researcher, the fear of failure, and the fear of the unknown, focusing specifically on cramped, dingy spaces, like libraries or archives, and leaning away from the more elegant gothic motifs that characterize Dark Academia or Darkest Academia. Horror academia is a dreary, depressing aesthetic that reflects the difficulty and laborious workload of real academia, manifesting in the spooky, grimdark, and monstrous horror ambience of the aesthetic. '), ('Hot Topic', "Hot Topic is an aesthetic surrounding the fashion and products from the shop of the same name throughout its long and storied history. Hot Topic is seen as the epicenter for many an alternative aesthetic throughout the '90s and into the present day. The shop has faced criticism for being both a bandwagoner in terms of what's popular as well as being incredibly overpriced (considering you can get a lot of the same merchandise at other stores for cheaper prices). "), ('Hydrogen', 'Hydrogen is an aesthetic designed to evoke a vibe of a combination of calmness, a feeling of being static or frozen in time, and enough strangeness to feel slightly surreal. Common elements of Hydrogen, like lunar imagery and retrofuturism, are simply effective ways to evoke these three emotions. In the 1930s, gaseous hydrogen was used in zeppelins to make them float; this feeling of slow, retro-futuristic lighter-than-air-ness is what gives the aesthetic its name. '), ('Hypebeast', 'Hypebeasts (or Hype Beasts) are a youth subculture of usually male teenagers who collect limited-edition streetwear labels like Supreme, Palace, BAPE, Off-White and Yeezy. The clothes they buy are not defined really by their price, but mainly by their rarity. Because of such a high demand for limited edition items by some streetwear brands, retailers employ bouncers to manage crowds who are prepared to queue on the street for hours to buy the latest thing. Because of this demand, there is also an online market of reselling Hypebeast stuff. Hypebeasts usually wear clothing items that people would consider "drip".

This look can include: '), ('Hyperborean', 'Hyperborean is an aesthetic that is associated with beliefs of higher races and deities. The aesthetic is named for the the mythological Hyperborean people who lived in the far north, but it also includes amalgamation of various conspiracy theories ranging from Nordic aliens to hollow earth civilizations. It is associated with Esoteric Nazism, a form of neo-Nazism adapting mythological elements. It can also include the glorification of philosophers such as Jonathan Bowden. Hyperborean edits can also be referred to as Schizoposting or Schizowave which derives from the disorders schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, both commonly characterized by paranoid delusions and hallucinations. These disorders unfortunately are heavily stigmatized throughout media, and it is important to note and understand that not all people with schizophrenia are conspiracy theorists, and many find the name and the disorder being tied to this aesthetic offensive and/or harmful. There are some advocating for the lesser used names (which this page uses) to be more widely used as to not associate the disorder with a stigma. Some fans of the aesthetic commonly associate it with pre-Soviet conspiracy theories and attempt to link the disorder to said era as an explanation for the name, although the tie to schizophrenia is not there as the disorder had only been first noted to exist in 1887, 45 years before the start of the Soviet Union, and at that point, it was referred to as Dementia Praecox (essentially translating to childhood dementia). '), ('Hyperpop', 'Hyperpop is a genre of music that combines both EDM and traditional pop. The genre puts an extreme emphasis on cuteness, femininity and intoxication.

'), ('Icepunk', 'Icepunk, also called Icecore, is an aesthetic revolving around frozen, snowed-over and icy places which give an eerie and otherworldly feel. It shares elements with Cleancore, as the colours are similar (Icepunk being less bright and more misty) and frozen places typically have a smooth and sanitized feel to them. Icepunk is essentially the antithesis of seapunk and seems to have a bit of a rivalry with the microgenre. It\'s been described as "Seapunk in an ice age". It\'s said the term originated with rapper Drrty Pharms in an interview with Mishka: Icepunk, like seapunk, is more of a meme than it is a genre. I released the first ever icepunk song in October of 2011, entitled ◮◮◮Ice◮Queen◮◮◮. I wanted to mimic the numb, uncomfortable feeling of being cold….After the creation of seapunk, [Facebook groups] were flooded with posts proclaiming the death of witch house, posts antagonizing the seapunks and people claiming to have created the next meme genre. Most of the members of these groups felt excluded by seapunk, as best expressed by that image macro of a dolphin with the caption “you can’t sit with us”. I took it upon myself to become the messiah for those left behind by seapunk, creating my own Facebook group called i¢spunk, which featured a lengthy, ‘troll-statement’ explaining how icepunk was going to be the next big thing…'), ('Imaginarium', 'Imaginarium is an aesthetic that attempts to capture and illustrate the look and feel of pure, unclouded imagination, inspiration and total creative freedom. Despite being nearly limitless in its potential expression due to the nature of human imagination, Imaginarium tends to lean towards a somewhat abstract, highly colorful theme. The aesthetic combines many different elements, making it more visually interesting and especially appealing to younger demographics. Though not inherently childish or aimed at children, Imaginarium does take on many childlike qualities, such as the use of playroom-type environments, vibrant colors and well-known fantastical motifs. Often illustrated as a dream-like world that exists parallel to our own or simply as a creative addition to everyday life, this aesthetic is mainly based on alternative interpretation and recombination of existing themes in a playful, lighthearted way, similar to that of a pleasant surreal dream. Imaginarium has no ties to any particular medium, setting or form of expression while still being largely reliant on familiar, recognizable concepts, separating it from similar aesthetics such as Craftcore, Kidcore or Psychedelica. Imaginarium is versatile, and thus allows for exploration of somewhat darker and creepier themes within its realm while still maintaining an intriguing, creative atmosphere. Examples of this can be seen with one of (PSVita) Little Big Planet\'s in-game locations called the "Spooky Mansion". Note that while this aesthetic can be used in interpretation of psychedelic experiences, it is primarily meant to represent the creative wanderings of a sober mind.'), ('Imperial Romanov', 'Imperial Romanov is an aesthetic based on the life and culture of the Romanov Dynasty, especially of the family of Nicholas II.

The International Typographic Style primarily emphasizes typography and visual communication, while the Swiss Style encompasses a broader range of graphic design styles from Switzerland, particularly during the 1950s and 1960s. Nevertheless, both movements have the same core principles of clarity, objectivity, and functionality. This movement has left a lasting impact on various fields such as graphic design, art, and architecture.

They have also been known for heavy drug and alcohol use, often partaking in drug trafficking. Crime cases that involved Mafia members were of high popularity at the time of occurrence, making the members and bosses notable historical figures.

This topic is written into many fictional novels and fanfictions where authors and readers may use it as an escape into a more exciting life. A common name/term for the subject is "mafia princess" in which the main character is swooped away into or is involved in the Mafia and treated like royalty. Care should be taken when portraying this aesthetic to prevent supporting or romanticizing the Italian Mafia, as it was a dangerous criminal organization associated with terrorism and drugs, and it was used to stereotype Italian immigrants as being criminals.

They utilized communist symbology like other movements, but also developed their own unique fashion, writing, and even architecture.

Accompanying tropes are the use of tribal elements, whether it be Mayan-esque pyramids and masked natives in media or exotic percussion, string and woodwind instruments in music. Additionally, there might be mentions and/or the inclusion of dinosaurs and paleontological themes. A small amount of animations and games also partake in an aesthetic similar to Jungle Grunge. '), ('Karasu Zoku', 'Karasu Zoku (烏族) was a japanese movement during the 1980s that consisted of wearing all-black designer outfits. While similar fashion trends are still around, the term is no longer used due to the base association with violent gangs around the height of its popularity, and "Mode fashion" (モードファッション) is used instead. '), ('Kawaii', 'Kawaii (かわいい) is a Japanese term and aesthetic referring to the unique concept affirming childlike and pretty things that make your heart flutter. However, different from the English word "cute", it is distinct in that it\'s so diversified that it has spawned many subgenres which often are far removed from the original concept. For example, Gurokawa refers to "creepy cute" things and Erokawa to everything "erotic but cute” which combines adult sexuality with cuteness. The kawaii aesthetic is also a staple in J-fashion, and many of its derivative sub-aesthetics originate from the Harajuku neighborhood and surrounding Shibuya district of Tokyo. The concept of kawaii is often misunderstood in foreign countries and wrongly applied to anything "chibi".'), ('Kawaii Gamer', 'Kawaii Gamer, also known as Pastel E-Girl or Gamer Girl, is a westernized version of Kawaii(although it can be seen among Otaku as well) that is popular amongst gamers, Twitch streamers, and anime fans. The Kawaii Gamer community gathers on Twitch frequently and tends to be Gen Z. This differs from other forms of Kawaii in that it contains specific merchandise, room decor, and fashion trends that are more aligned with the Western interpretation of Kawaii, as opposed to actual Japanese Kawaii fashions, similar to what is seen in Cutecore. showing increased globalization as anime and games reach a larger audience. The objects common in the aesthetic are incredibly replicated, and the aesthetic is shown in TikToks that are dedicated to showing the set-ups of a kawaii gamer. While the aesthetic requires a large quantity of merchandise (as maximalism is common), it is more accessible and casual than actual J-fashion due to the rise of Kawaii culture globally and the increased e-commerce and commercialization of media properties. Kawaii Gamer Girl fashion is highly inspired by the Erokawa, Babygirl, Soft Girl, and Neko aesthetics. Some women in this aesthetic put on the persona of a "gamer girl," where they advertise their love for video games, have a cute physical appearance, and bubbly personality through making TikTok videos and content on Twitch and YouTube. There are also some women who incorporate this aesthetic into their sexual presentation, as the Babygirl aesthetics evolve and grow more popular. Others focus exclusively on room decor/electronics, unboxing merchandise, and collecting inspiration and do not show themselves on camera. These people, typically women, are expressing their femininity and love for these certain characters in a hobby that is traditionally dominated by men and male aesthetics. For example, most gaming merch is in black and red with aggressively sleek detailing, which isn\'t palatable for many girls. Kawaii gaming aesthetics would thus allow women interested in video gaming to have their own community where they do not have to sacrifice their femininity for their hobbies. Some kawaii gamers also focus on breaking the idea of there being a difference between "real" games and "casual" games, as many people (especially men) believe that more action and competition-driven games are superior to ones with lower stakes. '), ('Kawaii Warrior', 'Kawaii Warrior is an aesthetic considered a mixture of Scene, Furry, and Old Emo Art Style. It heavily features bright colors and anthropomorphic animals, and was most popular in the late 2000s and early 2010s, when Sparkledogs were at the height of their popularity. Although confused for Poster Gal, Kawaii Warrior differentiates from Poster Gal due to Kawaii Warrior being more prominent in the late 2000s, having a less nerdy tone, and featuring animal characters extensively, with a few exceptions. This aesthetic has faced a resurgence in recent years, despite it never having truly gone away. '), ('Kidcore', 'Kidcore is an aesthetic that centers around bright colors, nostalgia for icons from the 90s, and kid themes. It is very similar to Nostalgiacore in terms of visuals. While its origins can be traced back to the 70s, 80s, 90s, and 2000s, it appears the aesthetic is a nostalgia-based creation of the 2010s. J-fashion styles, namely Decora, influenced this aesthetic, although Kidcore is less over the top and focuses more on childhood nostalgia and bright colors (Decora is often bright but can be any color scheme). Kidcore differs from Babycore as it is more focused on bright colors, cartoons, nostalgia, toys and accessories, as opposed to soft pastels, stuffies, soft kawaii fashion, and baby items. Both are associated with reclaiming a sense of childhood wonderment. Fairy Kei fashion is sometimes mistakenly called Pastel Kidcore, since it also features retro, nostalgic inspired motifs, but they are in fact different things and Kidcore centers around being bright and not pastel. '), ('Kid Science', " Kid Science is the aesthetic surrounding educational efforts to make science appealing to children through presenting the field as fun, with kooky characters, bright colors, highly stylized images, and doable experiments. Different schools, museums, television programs, and children's toys utilize the aesthetic to inspire students to pursue science in the future. Because of this, many young children go through a phase in their life where they are obsessed with a subject such as dinosaurs or train engineering. Unfortunately, many of the efforts into kid science are marketed towards boys, but the subject is gender-neutral. It emphasizes all fields, but paleontology, zoology, entomology, and astronomy are the most popular subjects. Because the children are not advanced enough to understand the basis of multiple subjects such as DNA or mathematics, great emphasis is put on imagination, memorization, and simple experiments that could be done at home. Teachers and exhibit designers seek to show students the scientific processes directly, with tours, pets, and movies. "), ('Kimoicore', 'Kimoicore, with kimoi (キモい) translating to "gross" or "disgusting", is an aesthetic revolving around often gory or unsettling media that contains surrealism, anime-like styles, horror, and technology. This aesthetic often brings either a sense of comfort or disgust, as most images depict a crossover of Ghibli fantasy, and Silent Hill-inspired nightmares. It is commonly confused with Weirdcore and Gurokawa, the latter being based around cute horror themes. Kimoicore is often gore oriented with common themes of monsters, glitches/static, and emotional distress or comfort (i.e. paranoia, mania, bliss). '), ('Kinderwhore', 'Kinderwhore, was a clothing style worn by a handful of predominantly female Punk bands in the United States during the early to mid-1990s. It\'s often thought that Kat Bjelland from the band Babes in Toyland was the first to wear and define the look, while her former roommate Courtney Love from the band HOLE was the first to popularize it. Courtney Love commented in 1994 that "I would like to think—in my heart of hearts—that I\'m changing some psychosexual aspects of rock music. Not that I\'m so desirable. I didn\'t do the kinder-whore thing because I thought I was so hot. When I see the look used to make one more appealing, it pisses me off. When I started, it was a What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? thing. My angle was irony." The name \'Kinderwhore\' was coined by melody maker journalist Everett True in an interview with Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love (1993). The term was mostly used by the media and less by the musicians themselves. Despite the name, the aesthetic has nothing to do with child prostitution. The term comes from the word "kinder" (meaning "children" in German), and "whore," (slang for a prostitute or sexually promiscuous person (usually female)). The name does not refer to a child prostitute, rather a child and a prostitute, as in two separate archetypes: an innocent child on one side, and a corrupted woman on the other. One interpretation is that it enables women to "take their innocence back". An often mentioned inspiration for the style are the musicians Kim Shattuck of the band The Muffs, Christine Amphlett of the band Divinyls or Katie Jane Garside of the band Daisy Chainsaw. The Kinderwhore fashion became a source of inspiration for many designers, such as Hedi Slimane, Batsheva Hay, and even Marc Jacobs. In 2019, Batsheva Hay named Courtney Love\'s “Kinderwhore aesthetic” as a big inspiration. Hay said the look was "so of its time, but also so ahead of its time". Dark Nymphet and Morute are both heavily inspired by Kinderwhore. '), ('Kingcore', "Kingcore is a variant of Royalcore that revolves around the imagery and power of portrayed kings in history, folklore, and fictional work. Like Queencore is to Princesscore, Kingcore is a more mature variant of Princecore. Themes of power, war, and conquest are more often seen here, as kings are most often viewed as malicious entities; although this is not true for all works or historical accounts. Kingcore aesthetics show through strength and guidance, skill and patience. Those who adopt a Kingcore aesthetic may be seen as the leader of a group. They hold themselves to higher standards, as a way to show worthiness of their title and position. The Kingcore aesthetic wouldn't be complete without confidence and displays of good leadership. A different approach using evil kings as inspiration can prove ill-advised, as this may make the person appear selfish and inconsiderate with a disregard for others. Inspiration can be drawn from patriarchal figures in hierarchy-centered shows and movies, especially those centered around kingdoms. For a darker approach, colors can be toned deeper, and inspiration can be drawn from evil king characters and CEOs. This aesthetic can be great inspiration for modern styles. It tends to overlap with other aesthetics (especially its darker variants) particularly fey styles like Dark Fairycore, Woodland Goth, and Forestpunk. Unlike Princecore, it can be seen (sparingly) worn by men outside of ballet and theater, but is almost never worn by women. "), ('King Gas', 'The King Gas aesthetic circles around North American culture and the frequent industrial usage of oil and gas, as well as the communities and jobs tied to this particular sector of work. This aesthetic also heavily uses the themes of patriotism, pollution, and poverty in order to give it a realistic feel similar to what many industrial communities in the United States and Canada feel on a daily basis. '), ('Kiwiana', 'Kiwiana is a term referring to the culture, heritage of New Zealand predominantly from the 20th century that are iconic and exclusive to New Zealand. The term Kiwiana refers to the Kiwi, the national bird of New Zealand and the nickname of New Zealand peoples. The term is also used to describe any and all New Zealand icons, pop culture items such as toys or branded foods; national icons of New Zealand have become Kiwiana. These include the kiwi and the hei-tiki. '), ('Knightcore', 'Knightcore is a Royalcore sub-aesthetic inspired by medieval knights. Knightcore has a large presence on Tumblr. There is also a portion of the aesthetic community that related Knightcore to Rangercore, using the shared themes of combat and nature visuals. Like the related aesthetic Princecore, a section of this aesthetic is centered around gay relationships and the two are often paired together. '), ('Kogal', "Kogal (コギャル) refers to the aesthetic of members of the Gyaru subculture who are students and therefore still have to wear a school uniform. The name comes from a contraction with kōkōsei, the Japanese word for school. Thus, Kogal is not strictly a type of Gyaru fashion on its own but rather the name for Gyaru that are students. Technically, adult Gyaru who wear a Kogal outfit aren't considered Kogals since they are just wearing Nanchatte Seifuku. This fashion is referred to as Impersonation Kogal (なんちゃってコギャル) or Gyaru Seifuku (ギャルい制服). (It's a bit of pedantic distinction, but the English community tends to correct others on it.) While the peak period of the classic Gyaru subculture was during the late 1990s and early 2000s, Kogal peaked in the mid-1990s, especially around the period 1994-1995. The aesthetic emerged around 1993 amongst younger girls (especially high school girls and middle school girls) trying to emulate the adult-like sexiness and confident self-assertion of Bodikon gals— something especially common in early 1990s Japan. The 1993 television special Za kogyaru naito (The Kogal Night) introduced the kogal to a mass audience and provided a model for aspiring Kogals to follow— promoting controversial activities popular amongst those older Bodikon women such as prank-calling and enjō-kōsai (compensated dating). Around late 1994, as Bodikon died with the closure of Juliana's Tokyo and the end of magazines such as Heaven's Door, the style of Kogals broke into the mainstream and by early 1995 became commonplace among teenage girls. Kogals were popularly troped in the Japanese media in the mid-1990s as being obsessively trend-conscious. A major influence on the style was J-pop singer Namie Amuro, who in 1994 popularised platform shoes. Her music became a major staple amongst Kogals, and her tanning also became widely adopted by them. "), ('Korean Cozy Beige', 'Korean Cozy Beige is an aesthetic that describes the aesthetic community in Korea that largely centers around images of domesticity in a neutral color palette with ivory, brown, and beige tones. People in Korea generally post these photos to cohesive Instagram accounts, which later get re-uploaded onto Pinterest.

In Japan, hardcore fans of the character are also refered to as Kuromiota (クロミオタク).Kuromicore's origins in the dark alternative Jfashion scene have made it a staple in fashion styles such as Yami Kawaii, Dark Girly and Jirai Kei. In the west, it has a strong connection in aesthetics such as E-girl, Pastel Goth, Dark Babygirl, and general dark styles in touch with Japanese aesthetics and trends. It is also paired heavily with Melodycore, its opposite twin aesthetic based on Kuromi's rival My Melody. "), ('Labcore', 'Labcore is an aesthetic characterized by bright colors, especially purple and green, and to a lesser extent monochrome black and whites. This aesthetic combines the academia aspects of Science Academia and the 80s aspects of Vaporwave to make a mad scientist fashion aesthetic. This aesthetic was heavily influenced by films such as Frankenstein and Reanimator. '), ('Larme Kei', 'Larme Kei (ラルム系) is a style described by the overseas community centered around the early issues of the Japanese fashion magazine LARME that features a dainty feminine aesthetic catered towards women in their 20s. The term on its own is not used in Japan, and the core style of the magazine is known as "Girly fashion" (ガーリーファッション) or "Girly Kei" (ガーリー系). Much of the magazine also focused on hair and makeup, which always followed a hyper-feminine and kawaii style, with liberal use of pinks, browns, and glitter. The hairstyles are incredibly elaborate, with bangs being a must. '), ('Larpercore', 'Larpercore is a very edgy and dark aesthetic that originated in various underground online communities from Discord. While "LARP" usually stands for "Live Action Role-Playing" (a harmless hobby that involves roleplay), in this context, it\'s used to describe people who take on extremely edgy personas online. Larpercore users often pretend to be part of the military or claim to support extremist political movements on the internet, including but not limited to Nazism or Pro-Putin (Z). They form online groups that act like "clans" or "cults", and use special symbols and "clan tags" in their usernames to show which group they belong to. Users associated with this aesthetic are known for their shocking and offensive content, and its followers often engage in cyberbullying, extortion, and other forms of harmful online behavior. The aesthetic is primarily defined by its community\'s attitude and secondly by its extremely edgy aesthetic that is prevalent in these online circles. On social media, the followers of this aesthetic often form part of specific communities that portray themselves as "clans", or even "cults" in extreme cases. They typically present themselves online by using initials in their usernames (for example: UЖ, AFF or AGS) to indicate group membership. Along with that, they also use rare Unicode characters or put "titles" that mimic the royalty on their usernames to show everyone how many times they\'ve been banned from the platform (for example, someone with "the 13th" on their username or user biography would indicate that they have been banned 12 times). The users also have their own dinstinctively offensive terminology which may confuse people who are not associated with the community. '), ('La Sape', 'La Sape (also known as The Society of Ambianceurs and Elegant People) is a subculture centered on the cities of Kinshasa and Brazzaville in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Republic of Congo respectively.

Although it was a nation-wide phenomenom, with local scenes in various cities such as Vigo, Valencia, Oviedo, Puertollano and Torremolinos, the most well known movement was centered around Madrid (known in Spanish as La Movida Madrileña). It was a period of societal change; homosexuality was no longer criminalized, contraceptives became widely avaiable, regional languages were no longer persecuted and the feminist movement resurged after being considered a taboo topic. The movements were characterized by experimentation, social liberation, and a rejection of past conservative norms, and Las Movidas encompassed diverse fields, including music, film, fashion, visual arts, aesthetics and theatre. '), ('Laser Grid', 'Laser Grid is a visual design aesthetic that developed in the 80s. It is characterized by laser-like visuals on dark backgrounds, a grid motif, and airbrushed chrome effects.

'), ('Late 2000s Elementary School', 'Late 2000s Elementary School describes the nostalgic memories of people attending American/Canadian elementary schools from the mid 2000s to the early/mid 2010s. During this time, many fads appeared, with different activities within the classroom, new computer programs, food, toys, and fictional works being highly well-known among people who went to elementary school. This page also relates to the after-school visuals related to this age set, so it is not necessarily always taking place in school. Now, many people from Generation Z discuss the memories and post memes about that time online. '), ('Light Academia', 'Light Academia is an academic aesthetic and the visually lighter counterpart of Dark Academia. Dark Academia typically involves intense and negative themes, including literary tragedy, existentialism, heartbreak, oppression, substance abuse, depression, and death. In contrast, Light Academia’s themes are generally positive, focusing on optimism, sensitivity, joy, gratitude, friendship, motivation, and happy endings. '), ('Lightcore', 'Lightcore is an aesthetic that revolves around mainly the opposite of darkcore. This aesthetic is based on a set of light rooms, hence the name.

'), ('Ligne Claire', 'Ligne Claire (in Flemish Dutch: Klare Lijn, in English: Clear Line) is a Belgian visual art style that is characterized by the use of simple, bold lines and minimal shading to create a clean and distinct look. This style is often used in comics, cartoons, and illustrations to create a sense of clarity and simplicity. Ligne Claire was created and popularized by the comic artist Hergé, known for creating the famous comic series called The Adventures of Tintin. Although it was originally closely associated to the Tintin comic strips, it quickly became a popular illustration choice in Walloon/Belgian and French comics made by a diverse range of authors, including Joost Swarte, Yves Chaland, and Charles Burns. Eventually, this style became virtually synonymous with European comic strips. The term "ligne claire" was coined by Joost Swarte in 1977, and this style was formerly known as the "Hergé Style" or "Tintin Style" due to its connotations in popular media. '), ('Lil Girl', 'Lil Girl is a feminine substyle of Kidcore with Softie influences. It can also be inspired by the quirky young girl style inspired by the saying "I\'m not like other girls" and bubblegum pop songs. It should not be confused with the Babygirl aesthetic, which has no influence from Kidcore and is instead inspired by Kawaii and other aesthetics. '), ('Liminal Space', 'Liminal Space aesthetics revolve around pictures of transitional areas devoid of life, such as malls in the early morning, empty parking lots or a school hallway during summer. The appeal of liminal spaces is often assigned to their frozen and slightly unsettling appearance, but also the indefinite sense of familiarity they evoke. The depicted spaces often include late 20th and early 21th century architecture and furniture, linoleum tilings, ceiling tiles and cool-toned fluorescent lighting that creates a detached, unwelcoming and cold feeling, but the aesthetic has evolved to adapt to a multitude of settings and media formats. '), ('Lit Kid', "Lit Kid is an Academia aesthetic with hints of Kidcore mixed in. It centers primarily around children's literature and focuses on whimsy, imagination, and learning. A good example of this aesthetic would be the children's section of a public library. "), ('Live Laugh Love', 'Live Laugh Love is an aesthetic that centers around a combination of a specific kind of feel-good slogans (usually presented as word art wall signs or decals) and brushy, frequently chunky script fonts. It is found both in a basic, cheerfully oblivious and straightforward form, and in a more ironic format that centres around "wine mom" imagery. '), ('Lobotomy Chic', 'Lobotomy Chic is an aesthetic that focuses on exploring femininity through meta-irony, detachment and nihilism. It is also heavily influenced by different early 2000s aesthetics such as Indie Sleaze and Americana, as well as Tumblr nostalgia from the early 2010s. It is mostly used by girls who feel empowered by detaching from reality and acting as though apathetic and mysterious. The name was coined by writer Rayne Fisher-Quann on her article “The cult of the dissociative pout”. The term is a combination of “Heroin Chic” which glamourizes an unhealthy and deathly, detached style, and "Lobotomy" - a procedure that was executed on mental patients during the 1950s and caused them to act mentally detached and out of place. Many lobotomy-chic girls jokingly state how they need to get this procedure, pointing at the aesthetic’s twisted-dark-humor nature. What distinguishes this aesthetic from other online-feminine aesthetics is the focus on apathy and “not caring” as a means of being powerful and attractive; instead of characterizing yourself as a strong, bossy woman (for example, like the waif aesthetic) or contrary to that, showing femininity through being delicate and soft, the lobotomy chic aesthetic doesn’t practice either, and instead its main goal is to come across as broad and undefinable as possible; you act uninterested and unbothered to maintain the same performance of powerfulness and independence but in a different manner. As Fisher-Quann writes: ”[Lobotomy-chic] still cares about being sexy, but knows there’s nothing sexy about caring too much. And in times of discord, chaos, and fear, a cultural descent into nihilism makes sense.”'), ('Lo-Fi', 'Lo-Fi is a musical genre and aesthetic that uses muted tones and mundane imagery to evoke a feeling of calm and nostalgia. Primarily a genre of music, the minimal melody and repetitive cadence of Lo-Fi encourages people to stop in the moment and pay attention to the world around them, as opposed to the often-cynical use of nostalgia in other aesthetics. Visually, Lo-Fi features muted colors with simple or complex graphics amidst a peaceful scene. Other aesthetics can blend with Lo-Fi, including Vaporwave, Animecore, Cartooncore, Dazecore, and Vintage, so long as the minimalism is preserved. '), ('Lolailo', 'Lolailos are a subculture and urban tribe originary from the region of Córdoba in Andalusia (Southern Spain), although they can be also found in other regions of Spain such as Madrid or Catalonia, especially in crowded areas or carnivals. The term Lolailo was originally an onomatopeia referring to some forms of traditional music from Andalusia, although later it began to be used to describe people. It is a subculture heavily influenced by the music and culture of Cuba, and it is particularly associated with the Caló Roma people of southern Spain. The music genres associated with Lolailos are Rumba and Flamenco, especially when played in the bars of southern Spain, where they can often be found playing the Spanish guitar or singing. They are stereotypically described as men who act offensivily or aggresivily and use bad-mouthed language despite trying to be elegant, although at the same time they are full of joy. Their stereotypical fashion style is really easy to recognize: they wear Campero hats, red shirts with white polka dots, black short pants and and red fajínes (belts). They often have long and curly hairstyles, and sometimes they defy gender stereotypes by wearing makeup and stereotypically feminine accessories. In some instances they are associated with the drag queen movement, or are derogatorily described as "annoying" or "gross".

It\'s characterized by its somewhat loosely-defined fashion style featuring maximalist elements, bright colours, cartoon and manga prints, glitter and the combination of clashing textures, prints, colours, shapes and hemlines. The aesthetic is childhood-themed and promotes a good sense of humor and lighthearted self-mockery. Given its silly and funny nature, it was termed "LOLcore" by fashion experts. Relating to other fashion styles, it supported the empowerment of Alternative fashion styles and opposed Normcore and rejected Minimalism and the fashion standards of the time. Many elders also participated in this fashion trend to break the stereotype that elders can\'t have fun or be silly anymore. Some notable celebrities who participated on this aesthetic at some point include Anna Dello Russo, Lily Allen, Rita Ora, Miley Cyrus and Katy Perry. '), ('Lolita', 'Lolita (ロリータ) is a Japanese fashion culture inspired by girls\' and young women\'s clothing styles from the Victorian and Rococo periods. It grew from young women\'s desire to dress for themselves in a way that disregarded other people\'s opinions and women\'s fashion catered to the male gaze. The style is characterized by a distinctive silhouette, achieved from wearing petticoats underneath dresses or skirts with a specific cut. Decoration associated with historical girls\' clothing, such as lace, bows, and ruffles, are a mandatory component of the fashion, but there are different substyles that utilize variations on this to create a different aesthetic. This fashion is heavily associated with certain brands specializing in Lolita and different substyles, and Lolitas must purchase their clothes through these stores and the secondhand market instead of typical fashion retailers, which would not have such clothes. Lolita is a subculture that revolves around fashion, so only people who wear the fashion are considered a part of it. Like other fashion subcultures, the emphasis is always on the clothing and the visuals not associated with the fashion are based on other aesthetics, such as Goth. However, there may be a "lifestyle" component to Lolita, wherein some Lolitas participate in princess-like activities such as tea-drinking. Participating in lifestyle elements is less popular and considered unnecessary from 2018-2020 onwards, and the fashion has always been focused on collecting garments and coordinating pieces together. In addition to wearing the clothes, there is a tight-knit community with a shared history, inside jokes, a strong criticism culture, and multiple discussions that take place both in real life through local meet-ups and on social media spaces such as Discord channels, Facebook groups, the now unpopular LiveJournal, and the 4chan board /cgl/, which also includes cosplay. Tradition and following the general guidelines of Lolita is mandatory, and low-quality garments and bad styling is highly discouraged.

Themes of childhood, nature, and the beach are commonplace, due to many leaving for the big city. Long Island died out early in the early 2010's when the internet became less localized. It draws from Americana the most whether purposefully or not. How ever it mixed with rich local culture to create its own unique spin on the Americana trope. "), ('Lounge', "Lounge is an aesthetic that draws on a lot of inspiration from the late 50's/early 60's space age/Tiki Bar aesthetic one would often see in Las Vegas around that times. "), ('Lovecore', 'Lovecore, which shares the visuals and ethos of Valentine\'s Day, is based on the visual culture of manufactured romance. The forms of love that the aesthetic specifically focuses on are affectionate, dopamine-filled, and "gushy." It can involve both requited and unrequited relationships, with both crushing on someone from afar and the rituals of dating being shown in these images. Relationships could be both new and juvenile or old and familiar. The more mature and philosophical or seductive and erotic aspects of love are not featured, as visually, these often do not match the visuals and younger audience of Lovecore. However, people who enjoy the aesthetic are not necessarily actively crushing on anyone or in a relationship depicted in the aesthetic. The aesthetic largely speaks about crushes and relationships in the theoretical, with there not being a true person that the original poster is thinking about. People who enjoy romance fiction, queer people who celebrate love, and people who wish for romantic experiences are some examples of people who appreciate the aesthetic. Visually, Lovecore tends to focus on the commercialization of love through Valentine\'s Day decorative trends. The rituals associated with romance are also heavily featured, especially in text. The aesthetic has substyles that can emphasize vintage, anime or Cottagecore visuals. Lovecore originated on Tumblr but later spread to many other platforms such as TikTok and Pinterest. '), ('Low Poly', 'Low Poly is the aesthetic of 3D models with a low amount of polygons. It is used for 3D art and video games, usually ones created by indie developers. Low poly was originally used to improve performance in games running on low powered consoles in the 1990s, but with technological advancements, it is now embraced by developers as an intentional stylistic choice. The way modern low poly is utilized as an art form heavily connects to Modernism and its rejection of Realism. Low poly art embraces being unique and different from reality, opposing the many games focusing on having the most photorealistic graphics as possible.'), ('Lunarpunk', 'Lunarpunk is a more tentative, lesser-defined aesthetic. It is regarded as the sibling aesthetic of Solarpunk. It embraces spirituality and utopian futures, referencing witchcraft, futuristic design, nature, renewable energy, and the circle of life. These worlds focus on introverted details of oneself and/or the environmental setting rather than a greater community or singular "one." As Tumblr user solarisrebellio words it, "...you would be more likely to see small sects of persons worshipping (or devoting to) The Self rather than The Other." In symbolism and tarot, the moon represents things such as illusion, subconscious, higher self, emotions, and change. '), ('Mad Scientist', 'Mad Scientist is a fictional trope that revolves around a scientist who uses their knowledge for evil or utilizes villainy to support their research. Because of the different homages, references, and practical writing necessities in media featuring these characters, the trope has a consistent visual aesthetic. '), ('Magical Girl', 'Magical Girl (魔法少女) is a character trope, as well as a genre of fiction which centers both around the concepts of girls coming of age and possessing power through their femininity rather than by rejecting it. It is a common theme for the protagonists to need to balance their school lives, personal lives, and their responsibilities of saving the world as a Magical Girl. The aesthetic is often hyper feminine and very in touch with expressing emotion freely, both positive and negative. Magical Girls are often in a team of young girls, destined to save the world. These characters often have their own designated color, weapon, and power assigned to them, although which colors, weapons, and powers can vary. Alongside these color coded costumes, a very iconic part of what makes a Magical Girl a Magical Girl visually is the animated transformation from a normal young girl into her Magical Girl identity. Sally the Witch by Mitsuteru Yokoyama was the first Magical Girl anime to air in 1966, whilst Himitsu no Akko-chan was the first Magical Girl manga (first printed in 1962), but the most well known and influential Magical Girl anime in pop culture is, for now, Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon (often shortened to Sailor Moon) by Naoko Takeuchi.

'), ('Major League Gaming', 'Major League Gaming (abbreviated as MLG) is a meme aesthetic that was popular roughly from 2013 to 2017. The term originated from the Esports organization of the same name and it used to be a way to refer to professional video game players, although later it was used to represent someone being very awesome, specifically in a video game. In the 2010s, it was shortened to MLG and began to be associated with a genre of internet memes that were based around video games. It usually is an video-based aesthetic, and the videos feature compilations of various Esports memes and flashing rainbows. During the early 2020s, MLG saw some resurgence because some Gen Z teenagers found comfort on it due to the nostalgia or the colorfulness of its aesthetic. In meme generationology, MLG is included as part of the "Dank Meme Era", and its sucessor is considered to be Surreal Memes and Deep Fried Memes, which together make up the "Surreal Era". '), ('Mallgoth', 'Mallgoth (also colloquially called Spooky Kid or Alternative Kid) is a term that was originally used as an insult to describe the fashion style of "Wannabe Goths" in the 80s, 90s, and 2000s who try to imitate the Goth fashion style without fully understanding the subculture beyond its stereotypical looks. Unlike the original Goth subculture which had its origins in Gothic Rock, Mallgoths were fully inspired by Goth\'s simple fashion and can often be found listening to Nu-Metal, Industrial Metal, and musical artists such as Marilyn Manson. "Mallgoth" is a portmanteau between "mall" and "goth", referencing how many participants of the subculture would often spend time at shopping malls. In particular, it often references them purchasing items from Alternative stores such as Hot Topic and Spencer\'s. The term began as pejorative, connoting solely being interested in Goth for its fashion, rather than the subculture itself, similar to the use of "poser". They are not actually considered apart of the Goth community because they share more in common with Metalheads. They can be considered to be one of the first communities using the “Goth” suffix who have wrongfully been lumped in the Goth community (such as Pastel Goth, Health Goth, etc.) but are involved in an entirely different musical subculture. They were usually found being inside of malls (hence their name), But they did exist in other as well obviously. Their main target was to scare people, They were often found snarling and hissing at the people that weren\'t alternative. They existed through hot topic\'s goth/nu-metal run, which slowly faded in the late 2000s, thus making mall goths a lot more absent. They used websites like MySpace, who was heavy in alternative people, and VampireFreaks (which was essentially a goth myspace.) Since Mall goths were a thing when internet was still in its early stage, you often see mall goths making their own websites on Angelfire, Geocities, Tripod, etc. They still exist and, for a little while, had fallen by the wayside as Nu-Goth and Witch House had taken its place as the Baby Bat culture of the modern era. However, in recent years, the Mallgoth aesthetic has been brought back into fashion as part of the overall Y2K revival that has been gaining more and more prominence, especially on social media sites such as TikTok, where they made a comeback. '), ('Mall Ninja', 'Mall Ninja is a braggadocious stereotype involving boasting about weapon proficiency and being "badass," despite a lack of mastery and respect for weapons practice. Obsessed with weapon tropes depicted in anime, action movies, or other violent fiction, the Mall Ninja is characterized by clumsy threats or posturing for superiority. Mall Ninja is an offshoot relation to the "Internet Tough Guy." The main aesthetic concept of the Mall Ninja is that of being a poor mimicry of a fictional badass character. Their weapons, which they often carry in the eponymous malls, tend to be tacky and based on items that they have seen in anime. For example, they would have unnecessary ornamentation like colors, have no practical function, and are made of poor quality materials. Likewise, the clothing that they can typically be seen wearing is cheap, may fit poorly, and looks tacky. This is not based purposefully on camp, but rather being inexperienced in judging quality. Most of the aesthetics and hobbies also overlap with Weeaboos. In fact, one of the main motivators of becoming a Mall Ninja could come from wanting to be like an anime character or because of the Dunning-Kreuger Effect which is defined as "a cognitive bias whereby people with low ability, expertise, or experience regarding a certain type of a task or area of knowledge tend to overestimate their ability or knowledge. Some researchers also include in their definition the opposite effect for high performers: their tendency to underestimate their skills." For example, a Weeaboo may mistake the hours of anime they watched as being hours of watching weapons training. These two groups, Weeaboos and Mall Ninjas, also share similar stereotypes such as a lack of hygiene, anti or asocial personality traits, "basement-dwelling", and an over-obsession with their hobbies. '), ('Mallsoft', 'Not to be confused with Mallcore, a derogatory term often used to describe genres with "whiny" vocals such as Pop Punk, Nu-Metal, and Emo.Mallsoft (also known as Mallwave) is an aesthetic centered around the shopping mall experience that was popular from the 1970s to 2000s (particularly in the "Memphis Design" era of the 1980s and early 1990s), until the "retail apocalypse" which has been slowly forcing already struggling malls to die off. Initially conceptualized as a subgenre of Vaporwave, it has evolved into its own aesthetic that elicits a sense of nostalgia in many Gen Xers and Millennials (and potentially older members of Gen Z) using imagery of shopping centers and remixed anonymous soft rock muzak one might hear in a shopping mall. It can range from simply invoking the nostalgic memories of a trip to the mall as a child or it can go into the surreal category by turning up the echo and invoking the imagery of a long-abandoned mall still echo soft Muzak-y sounds throughout its long-empty and decaying halls. Abandoned malls can also have aspects of Liminal Space. But, of course, they aren\'t the same. As said before, it is meant to elicit nostalgia with visuals and music of shopping centers and music that is played there. Liminal Space\'s visuals are unsettling and bring back strange or bad memories. '), ('Malwarecore', 'Malwarecore is an internet aesthetic that evolves around the sketchy corners of the internet.

The word lost its pronunciation to adapt to the Portuguese language. Another name for the culture, "Nóia", is Brazilian slang and an abbreviation of the Brazilian word for neurosis.

The concept of a Mary Sue character heavily influenced the world of Internet fandoms, fanfiction and animation memes during the decade of the 2010s. The term is often used in a pejorative manner because the characters are seen as very unrealistic and unrelatable, and often deemed "cringe".

However, Medieval Fantasy is unlike Fantasy in that it specifically pertains to or is influenced by the Medieval period of European history, which was from the 5th century to the 15th century. Medieval England and influences from medieval English history are the most common, but the degree of influence varies wildly, with some Medieval Fantasy borrowing from elements from the Renaissance period, most notably in the style of the weapons and armor used around that time.

'), ('Memphis Lite', "Memphis Lite (or Contempo-Eclectic) is the corporatized, more palatable direct evolution of Memphis Design that arose because the latter was poorly suited to incorporate into existing home designs. Coming to encompass graphic design and fashion more so than interior design, Memphis Lite was prevalent in popular culture from roughly 1984 to 1997. It was succeeded in 1997 by the Y2K Futurism aesthetic. Memphis Lite's complete overshadowing of its parent in advertising, fashion and certain televisual works (such as game show sets) allowed Memphis Lite to supplant Memphis to the point that most Memphis revivals really harken to the Memphis lite aesthetic, a peculiarity most noticeable with the color palette stereotypical of Synthwave and Vaporwave.

The Messy French It Girl will go out and share a cigarette with the rockstar girlfriend, but will skip the 4 AM bedtime and hangover and instead meet you at 10:30 for an eight dollar café au lait. The Messy French It Girl\'s best friend is a model off duty, but that extreme dieting, all black wearing life is too rigid and somber for her ever-curious and spontaneous life. The Messy French It Girl loves how [the] coquette embraces femininity but [would] rather stick with ivory creams and beiges than baby pinks. The Messy French It Girl wakes up early but arrives late, has a cigarette with her Dom Perignon on her balcony, and loves matching her boyfriend\'s white button down with her Chanel pumps. She\'s a beautiful mess always put together but never perfect. She\'s a ruthless heartbreaker and a hopeless romantic.

Bands credited for the start of metal range from the heavy blues of Led Zeppelin, Blue Cheer, and Jimi Hendrix, to the occult rock stylings of Coven and Blue Öyster Cult, and on to the likes of Alice Cooper, Pentagram and Black Sabbath. Bands like MC5 and The Stooges were also crucial in presaging the hardening of rock music into both punk and metal styles. The 1970s and early 80s brought the "New Wave of British Heavy Metal", while various bands from the United States and continental Europe solidified some of the first subgenres - notably Doom metal and Power metal, as well as the popular and prolific Thrash metal scene. This sonic and subcultural diversification under the "heavy metal" umbrella would, notably, continue into the first decade of the 21st century. Because of the aggressive sound, it became cause for panic by Christian parents, who believed the music to be Satanic and a bad influence for children during the 80s.

Therefore, the Milipilis are also associated with a certain fashion style and with a particular socio-economic class, which in fact corresponds to the high-class who owns the greatest wealth and resources. The term Milipili is a portmanteau between the feminine personal names "Milagros" and "Pilar", perhaps two of the most popular names among the Generation Z in Argentina. Originally, it was used as derogatory term to refer to the conceited upper-class young women who boasted about having a lot of money, thus, both names are associated with the Argentine high-class. Nowadays, this term no longer has any connotations with social position and has completely turned into an aesthetic concept: young people who gave new life to the \'Y2K\' trend in a much more extreme way and mixed with other retro-themed fashion styles.

Modernism was a rejection of tradition and the Enlightenment values that had once consumed Europe.

During the last years of the 19th century, new art trends surged in Europe, and most of them rejected traditionalist art values, as they were seen as restrictive and outdated. Even though at first Modernisme was part of one of those European trends, Art Nouveau, it actually developed a really unique style and became one of the most original and developed Modernist movements. Modernisme was highly influential in southwestern Europe and is known for its colorful architecture, as well as for some of the most important monuments of Europe, such as the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona. Architects such as Antoni Gaudí, Lluís Domènech i Montaner, and Josep Puig i Cadafalch and many more artists played an important place on shaping the architectural style of Modernisme. These artists started using new techniques, materials, and forms of expression that hadn't be tried yet to promote innovation and Avant-garde styles. Along with that, the idea of Gesamtkunstwerk was also promoted, which refers to adopting influence from many other art movements as means to collaborate with them and their artists. Some styles that influenced Modernisme are Art Nouveau, Symbolism and the Arts and Crafts Movement. Intellectual authors and artists who belonged to this movement also fought for the promotion of the Catalan culture and language, as well as regional autonomy, as part of the Renaixença movement in Catalonia, so the style also played a major role on the modernization of the Catalan cultural identity.

The real-life people portrayed in the memes are often Gangsters or people involved with Gangsta culture, rappers and problematic politicians (sometimes including terrorists), while the anime characters portrayed are often cute popular Anime characters and Neko characters. The appeal of this meme mainly comes from the fact that it mixes reality with fiction and two completely different worlds: Gangster culture has little to nothing in common with Otaku culture.

In the community, users often use it as an outlet for expressing trauma, especially those surrounding eating disorders and child abuse. The community largely developed from the music of Nicole Dollanganger and influential photographers such as Jess Woods and milliedollgraves, who have since deactivated. It is more commonly known as "Sadbbydoll", due to those in the aesthetic looking like sad baby dolls. Many visuals suggest physical abuse, sexual assault and molestation, emotional abuse and self-destruction, religious trauma, and physical disability. The child-like imagery serves as a desire to return to a girlhood that was ripped away from them, with the Christian, angelic, and cute motifs being an idealization of purity and innocence. Religious guilt is a common motif, with the desire to go to Heaven, but feeling unable due to the victim being "dirtied" with whatever traumatized them. Poverty within small-town Americana is also present, and it reflects the influence of horror movies and the idea of home being sullied and unsafe. It is a precursor to Traumacore, and that aesthetic is an example of convergent evolution, wherein two aesthetics express the same thing, but the later community is relatively unaware of its predecessor and its influences. The aesthetic is one that has largely fallen out of popularity due to the current notoriety of Traumacore, the insular community, mental recovery of many influencers, and discourse surrounding the aestheticization of dark themes. The community itself does not emphasize the necessity of actually having trauma. Many simply are visually attracted to the contrast between cutesy, girly, childish aesthetics with dark, creepy, gothic aesthetics, and there is no need to discuss or vent about past experiences.'), ('Motomami', 'Motomami (stylized as MOTOMAMI) is an experimental aesthetic created by Spanish singer ROSALÍA, primarily present in fashion, visuals and music.

It focuses on recognizing how even the littlest parts of the world that most people don't pay attention to can be actually really amazing and fascinating when you take the time to notice and learn about them. Mulchcore also values messiness, creativity, individuality, and support for others. "), ('Musical Academia', 'Musical Academia is an aesthetic involving the art and education of music theory, culture, creation, and learning instruments and vocal techniques.

Musical Academia is not strictly adherent to school curriculum, as self-teaching may be just as effective and valid within the aesthetic. '), ('Mythpunk', 'Mythpunk refers to a subgenre of mythic fiction in which classical folklore and faerie tales get hyper-poetic post-modern makeovers. Coined by author Catherynne M. Valente, the term describes a brand of speculative fiction which starts in folklore and myth and adds elements of post-modern fantastic techniques: urban fantasy, confessional poetry, non-linear storytelling, linguistic calisthenics, surrealism, world-building, and academic fantasy. Despite the term being coined recently, much of it seems to be influenced by 70s and 80s dark fantasy writing, this particularly includes authors Angela Carter and Tanith Lee. Even a few lighter writers like Patricia A. McKillip (see Elfpunk below) helped define the surreal strangeness inherent in this genre. It is characterized by baroque, multicultural fashion (in the 80s, this was likely inspired by New Romantic style), bold sexuality, bizarre retellings of familiar fairy tales, pervasive anxiety, fear of inevitable change, feminist parables, the brutality of humanity, the dark price of magic, surreal imagery, a twisted sense of humor, elaborate symbolism, and radical reinterpretation. Aesthetically, it’s extremely closely related to Woodland Goth (although the book genre tends to be much darker thematically). '), ('Nanchatte Seifuku', 'Nanchatte Seifuku (なんちゃって制服) is a Japanese fashion that represents the romanticized school life of female students as portrayed by popular media. The name translates to pretend school uniform, referring to how the fashion of the aesthetic is based upon wearing outfits that appear to be a school uniform. As an aesthetic, Nanchatte Seifuku heavily focuses on academic visuals and motifs but not so much about the learned subject matter, as the goal is to experience comfort and joy from themes and visuals similar to modest private school life as opposed to high-end boarding school aesthetics like Preppy or the American school based High School Dream. Main themes of the aesthetic include friendship, personal growth, learning, and more.'), ('Naturecore', 'Naturecore is an aesthetic surrounding the theme of animals and other nature related things (ie. plants, forests, flowers, etc).

Media in this genre often mainly revolve around seafaring as sailors or pirates. Nautical Fantasy media is often categorized as historical fiction as well. While Oceanpunk and Nautical Fantasy are similar - and you could consider Oceanpunk to fall under the umbrella of Nautical Fantasy - the main difference between the two is that Oceanpunk is specifically sci-fi and an often apocalyptic and/or post-apocalyptic sub-genre centred around humanity's relationship with the sea, whereas Nautical Fantasy is a fantasy sub-genre with the main setting being the sea or the main story taking place on or near the sea. "), ('Neon Noir', 'Neon Noir is an aesthetic that first emerged out of the Neo-Noir film genre during the 1980s.

It is particularly popular in SoundCloud underground Hip-Hop communities. '), ('Neko', 'Neko is an aesthetic related to the cat-people (most notably catgirls, and sometimes catboys) trope in anime and manga. Neko is the Japanese word for cat, the correct term for cat-people is technically neko-mimi. The trope may go back to 1924, but the culture rose in popularity during the 2010s when the trope became a part of otaku culture (see Animecore). Since then, it has become a staple in meme and stan culture as well, where users would edit images and videos to turn the subject into a cat-person. This aesthetic is really popular among the Kawaii Gamer community. Cat-girls are a staple in Erokawaii(sexy cute). Neko is a substyle of Petcore. This aesthetic is popular within the transfem community as their ideal post-transition selves. The charm of the Neko aesthetic is its exaggerated childlike femininity. This aesthetic is mostly expressed on Twitter and TikTok and various other social medias. Including cat-ears and cat-tails has become a staple on most Picrews (a Japanese site for avatar creation). Cat-people (aka Nekos) are generally normal humans with cat ears and a tail. However, some have other cat-like features like paws for hands or feet. They also have often have cat-like(especially kitten-like) personality traits such as being playful, cuddly, and even bratty. Other kinds of kemonomimis(animal-ears) exist, such as wolf-people, bunny-people, and fox-people, to name a few, and also take on traits associated with that animal. Please note that cat-people may not consider themselves furries; they wear cat ears, tails, and mittens that look like paws, but not full fursuits. Cat-people also do not identify as a cat, they simply enjoy dressing up or roleplaying. Certain cat-people are furries, however, but most of them are not. Neko and other kemonomimi styles are sometimes associated with the BDSM sub genre of Pet Play, which focuses on the power dynamic between an owner and pet (and can also sometimes be non-sexual). Kitten Play is a popular form of Pet Play which draws on cat girl tropes. Many people who wear Neko fashion are not, however, associated with Pet Play and simply enjoy the style. Because of the connection with Kitten Play, there is strong overlap between the Neko and Babygirl aesthetics, and the fashion is often very similar. '), ('Neoclassicism', "Neoclassicism is an art movement that is strongly influenced by the styles of ancient Greece and Rome, dominant from the mid to late 18th century until the 1830s. Inspired by the excavations of the ancient Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum from 1748, a renewed interest in the arts of antiquity occurred. Embracing order and restraint, it developed in reaction to the perceived frivolity, hedonism and decadence of Rococo and exemplifying the rational thinking of the 'Age of Enlightenment' (aka the 'Age of Reason'). Initially, the movement was developed not by artists, but by Enlightenment philosophers. They requested replacing Rococo with a style of rational art, moral and dedicated to the soul. This fitted well with a perception of Classical art as the embodiment of realism, restraint and order. Inspired by ancient Greek and Roman art, the classical history paintings of the French artist Nicolas Poussin (1594–1665) and the ideas of the German writer Anton Raphael Mengs (1728–1779) and the archaeologist and art historian Johann Joachim Winckelmann (1717–1768), Neoclassicism began in Rome, but soon spread throughout Europe. Rome had become the main focus of the Grand Tour by the mid-18th century, and aristocratic travellers went there in search of Classical visions to recreate on their country estates, thus spreading the style across Europe, particularly in England and France. The tour was also an opportunity for collecting Classical antiquities. Neoclassical paintings tended to be populated with figures posed like Classical statues or reliefs, set in a locations filled with archaeological details. The style favoured Greek art over Roman, considering it purer and more authentically classical in its aesthetic goal. In 1789, France was on the brink of its first revolution and Neoclassicism sought to express their patriotic feelings. Politics and art were closely entwined during this period. They believed that art should be serious, and valued drawings above painting; smooth contours and paint with no discernible brushstrokes were the ultimate aim. Both painting and sculpture exerted calmness and restraint and focused on heroic themes, expressing such noble notions as self-sacrifice and nationalism. This movement paved the way for Romanticism, that appeared when the idealism of the revolution faded away and after the Napoleonic period came to an end in the early 19th century. Neoclassicism should not be seen as the opposite of Romanticism, however, but in some ways an early manifestation of it. "), ('Neo-Breton Style', 'The Neo-Breton Style is a popular architectural style and home interior design that emerged in Brittany (France) during the 1960s, especifically after the Interwar period in Europe. Its distinctive style can be recognized by its use of traditional architectural elements originary from Brittany, such as whitewashed walls, black double-pitched slate roofs and granite frames and windows, combined with modern materials and techniques. This architectural style surged as a reaction to the growth of tourism in the region of Brittany, because it would grant a more modern yet traditional experience to visitors. Many Neo-Breton buildings were built in towns and villages near the sea, and can still be found throughout most of the region, typically in suburbs that were built during the 20th century. '), ('Neo-Celtic', 'Neo-Celtic or Neo-Celticism is an aesthetic, fashion style and artistic movement focusing on the revival of ancient Celtic cultures, practices and traditions through a Romanticistic point of view.

Neo-Celticism became really popular in the westernmost regions of Europe due to the influence of the Celtic Revival movement. '), ('Neo-Pop', 'Neo-Pop, also called New Pop, was a broad postmodern art movement that surged in the 1980s and 1990s. It is a resurgent, evolved and modern version of the ideas of Pop Art artists from the 50s, capturing some of its commercial ideas and Kitsch aspects. However, unlike in Pop Art, Neo-Pop takes inspiration from a wider amount of sources and techniques. Neo-Pop artists sometimes use imagery related to pop culture, such as cartoons, advertisements, and celebrities, but they often change the context of these images to create new meanings. This art movement gave origin to other art movements such as Lowbrow, Pop-Surrealism, and Superflat. '), ('Neo-Romanism', 'Neo-Romanism is an aesthetic influenced by Bronzepunk, Sandalpunk, Neoclassicism, Futurism and Renaissance, among others. It is also the judicial system that governs many 21st century democracies.

'), ('Neo-Tokyo', "Neo-Tokyo (ネオ東京) (sometimes referred to as Neon Tokyo and Neo City) is a style of Cyberpunk stylized by its fictional futuristic version of Tokyo and Japanese/Asian culture often depicted in manga, anime, and video games. Neo-Tokyo often features richly bright neon colours overlaid with Japanese text. Neo-Tokyo along side Cyberpunk are both likely the partial inspiration and anti-inspiration for Solarpunk, where instead of like Solarpunk where its main focus is a brighter and greener future, Neo-Tokyo instead features a larger range of civilization, and often features a some-what of an negative future covered by bright aesthetics. Neo-Tokyo is often associated with the cyberpunk genre of science fiction. The Neo-Tokyo setting first appeared in the Akira series of manga, anime film, and games. Neuromancer writer William Gibson described Tokyo as an inspiration behind his novel and the cyberpunk movement as a whole. He used the Chiba area of Tokyo as the novel's setting. The Neo-Tokyo setting was later used again in the Neon Genesis Evangelion series of mecha anime, films, and games. "), ('Neo-Tribal', 'Neo-Tribal, also commonly called Tribal Y2K, Cybersigilism or Cybertribal, is a visual design aesthetic that is primarily present in tattoos, shirts, band logos and album cover arts. Neo-Tribal design is characterized by its eye-catching patterns inspired by tribal tattoos, particularly those of Māori or Polynesian origin, but it is not limited to those cultures. It also uses other elements like symbolism, sigils and geometric patterns. Essentially, it mixes ancient ethnic patterns with modern art tecniques and aesthetics. Neo-Tribal symbology from the 2000s typically involves imagery that teenagers of the time found cool and rebellious, like angel, butterfly, demon and bat wings, crosses, hearts, etc. Consequently, Neo-Tribal art is often associated with various aesthetics and Alternative musical genres, including Y2K Futurism, Chromecore, Sigilkore, Deathcore, etc. The Neo-Tribal aesthetic isn\'t meant to be confused with the term neo-tribalism, which refers to the political philosophy concerning the concept of modern society being run by tribes.

'), ('Nerdcore', 'Nerdcore is an internet aesthetic and genre of music that has been around since the late 1990s. The term was first coined by MC Frontalot and he is widely considered to be the originator of the genre. Like many other aesthetics Nerdcore first arose from the eponymous music genre and came to fruition as its own separate aesthetic during the 2000s and 2010s. The aesthetic mostly revolves around 80s-2000s video games, science fiction (Star Wars & Star Trek predominant), role-playing games, tabletop games, internet memes & meme culture, and computer technology. The driving thrust of Nerdcore is the union of the braggadocius hip-hop attitude with an unabashed love of "nerdy" subjects. Instead of being ashamed of being a nerd, Nerdcore artists and fans are proud about it and refuse to hide it or conform to "weak nerd" stereotypes. Notable Nerdcore pioneers include the aforementioned MC Frontalot as well as MC Chris, Schäffer the Darklord, YTCracker, and Sensei Ion.

One of the key values is peacefulness, but this is not the same as harmlessness. it is advisable to understand the culture and history before making it a part of your identity. Dreamcatchers also have significant history to native America, but Celtic druids did make triangle-shaped dreamcatchers. '), ('New Beat', "New Beat is an underground electronic musical genre and subculture that emerged in Belgium during the mid-1980s, coinciding with the rise of Acid House music in Chicago and Detroit. Belgian New Beat is often associated with the R&S Records Label, which played an important role in popularizing this genre.

It commonly features the supernatural, such as witches, ghosts, demons, the Devil, and other strange entities. Like other Regional Gothic aesthetics, its popularity resurged during the mid 2010s, with added aspects of liminal space and specifically formatted text posts, but it has origins in Dark Romantic literature of the early 19th century.

Because of this, people with New Money can actually be much wealthier than those with Old Money, even as far as being billionaires. Unlike Old Money, it does not have an easily definable style, as New Money follows trends and is constantly changing. The youngest generation of an Old Money family (usually teenagers or young adults) might be closer to New Money due to conditions of inheritance and their desire to follow trends or rebel against their older relatives.

It was directly influenced and inspired by early 70s Glam Rock, especially David Bowie and Roxy Music. It emerged from the nightclub scene in London and Birmingham at venues such as Billy's and The Blitz. The New Romantic movement was characterized by flamboyant, eccentric fashion inspired by fashion boutiques such as Kahn and Bell in Birmingham and PX in London. Early adherents of the movement were often referred to by the press by such names as Blitz Kids, New Dandies and Romantic Rebels. Aesthetically it was a broad genre. The most famous visually is a Rococo, Glam Rock, and Native American inspired style perpetrated by Vivienne Westwood. The second is a suave, glamorous, futuristic detective mien likely inspired by David Bowie during his Thin White Duke phase, as well as Kraftwerk and Krautrock in general. New Romantic went on to influence the early Goth/Deathrock scenes and even the nascent Visual Kei, but itself ended in the mid 80s after the advent of LiveAid. It is particularly remarkable for being one of the few completely androgynous fashion movements, as there were no bounds as to what was worn by either gender. Interestingly, this was done purely in the name of self-expression and had no solid gender-political influence, which was in a show of separation from the ever politicized UK Punk. (Another one of the major influential aspects to OG Goth.) It can be considered a precursor to modern “pretty boy” bands, particularly those in J-Pop and K-Pop. (The members of Japan and Duran Duran being the most important visual “missing-links” with Japanese and Korean boy bands.) These men are called Khonminam (flower boys) and are popular with people in the Hallyu/Koreawave aesthetic. New Romantic briefly resurfaced in Britain as “Romo” in the mid-90s.

The main inspiration for this aesthetic was the Collection III by Mirror Palais, which included various extremely expensive dresses inspired by the Spanish colonial era. Many of these dresses were handcrafted by Mexican artisans, and multiple of them quickly sold out. Then, another main inspiration was the Cruise 2024 collection by DIOR, and its clothing pieces included Oaxacan ruffles and looks inspired by the Mexican artist Frida Kahlo. Women dressed up in this type of clothes usually post pictures of themselves near Catholic sites, like religious statues and candle altars in churches. '), ('New Wave', 'New Wave is a broad music genre that encompasses numerous Pop-oriented styles from the late 1970s and early 1980s. The term derived from the unrelated "French New Wave" and was originally used as a catch-all for the music that emerged after Punk, including punk itself, but may be viewed retrospectively as a less challenging counterpart of Post-Punk. Although new wave shared punk\'s DIY-philosophy, the artists were more influenced by the lighter strains of 1960s pop while opposed to mainstream "Corporate" rock, which they considered creatively stagnant, and the generally abrasive and political bents of punk rock. Common characteristics of new wave music include the use of keyboards, angular guitar lines, agitated or jittery vocals and song structure, and a distinctive visual style featured in music videos and fashion. '), ('Night Luxe', 'Night Luxe, similar to Boujee, is going out on a luxury night summarized. A little note that you could know is that it\'s not about what you wear, its about where you go (ex. New York, Montreal, Toronto, London).

'), ('Normcore', 'Normcore is a term used in fashion to describe a trend characterized by unpretentious, average-looking clothing. "Normcore" is a portmanteau of the words "normal" and "hardcore". The word first appeared in webcomic Templar, Arizona before 2009 and was later employed by K-Hole, a trend forecasting group, in an October 2013 report called "Youth Mode: A Report on Freedom". As used by K-Hole, "normcore" refers to an attitude, not a particular code of dress. It was intended to mean "finding liberation in being nothing special." However, an influential February 2014 piece in New York magazine conflated it with what K-Hole terms "Acting Basic", a concept under which dressing neutrally is a means to avoiding standing out. This broader sense of "normcore" as referring to understated and noncommittal attitudes to fashion gained popular usage. At the same time, many cultural references that are tied to broadly neutral fashion aesthetics, such as the characters featured on the television series Seinfeld, also exemplify to a significant extent the ethos of normcore in the more radical sense proposed by K-Hole. '), ('Northern Irish Muralism', 'Northern Irish Muralism is a political and propagandistic art movement in Northern Ireland which depicts the history and past of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland (also called The Troubles). The art is made from several political points of view, including but not limited to Unionism, Ulster loyalism and Irish Republicanism. Rarely, some murals may have no political affiliation. Generally, as they represent the history of The Troubles, they also use political and historical symbology representing the groups and political factions, which were or still are active in the area, the British royalty, the soldiers of a specific conflict, etc. Sometimes the murals may also honor and remember the people who passed away during terrorist attacks in the area, or people who fought for their faction during The Troubles (either loyalist Irish republican).

'), ('Noucentisme', 'Noucentisme was an art movement in the autonomous community of Catalonia (in northeastern Spain) that largely surged as a reaction against Modernisme and Art Nouveau, disagreeing with both its art style and ideology; completely rejecting all types of progressist Avant-garde or Romanticist political ideas. So instead, it embraced Neoclassicism. Noucentisme attempted to contradict all of the aspects of Art Nouveau and focused on a sense of order and balance, clarity, restraint and realism. It also drew inspiration from Roman and Ancient Greek art.The Catalan-language term "Noucentisme" was coined by the art critic Eugenio d\'Ors Rovira, who was a prominent figure in this art movemenet, and it can roughly translate to "nine hundredism" or "new centuryism" in English. Its name is in fact a reference to Italian stereotypical artistic periods names, such as Cinquecento or Quattrocento. Noucentisme was a multidisciplinary movement, having presence in Catalan art, cultural reforms, literature, architecture, political ideas and manifestos, among other fields. '), ('Nuclear', 'Nuclear is an aesthetic that is based around the themes of nuclear power, nuclear weaponry, machines and more. It involves gas masks, hazardous items, hazmat suits, and lands in ruins. The aesthetic is usually historical, specifically being based around the 1980s due to the large amount of nuclear power being built during the time as well as the ongoing cold war making nuclear warfare a constant fear. Modern nuclear aesthetic is more centered around urban exploration of abandoned nuclear sites, due to the end of the cold war and decline of nuclear power. '), ('Nu-Goth', 'Nu-Goth is the more modern take on the Goth subculture, although it has been decidedly controversial in the core scene. It’s rooted in and influenced by Trad Goth to a degree, but some in Nu-Goth style do consider certain musical genres to be Goth which have very little connection to what is accepted as Post-Punk-originating. Despite this, many other Nu-Goths do enjoy originating Goth music. For this reason, they are not discounted from the scene by Trad Goths. There are people who dress Nu-Goth that actually do like and appreciate Goth music, while others gravitate more towards Witch House, dark EBM artists, and the likes of Chelsea Wolfe and Zola Jesus (who do take some influence from darkwave). For this reason, they tend to be stereotyped as a gothic subculture that considers Goth to be a style/visual-based aesthetic more than being an aesthetic originally based in a musical subculture. Besides music, they are very different in their visual aesthetics than most Batcaver/Trad Goth types. Batcaver/Trad Goth is visually very broad, taking inspiration from all forms of mythology, Catholic imagery, and Gothic types of poetry, literature, and film. Nu-Goth imagery and fashion focuses far more heavily on the romanticization of witches, paganism, and the occult (even in comparison to the equally influenced Deathrock and Hippie Goth). This mix of sleek, modern clothes with witch/pagan images visually gives them more in common with Pastel Goth.

The Fest, a musical festival in Florida, was/is a major hub for Nu-Punk. Riot Fest was, and to some extent continues to be, another hub. Note: the author of this article came up in the Chicago Nu-Punk scene, so she apologizes for the overly Chicago centric aspects of this article. The hope is that people from other major Nu-Punk communities can contribute information on aspects of the aesthetic and scene in their regions. "), ('Nymphet', 'Nymphet, also sometimes referred to as Coquette or Vintage Americana Coquette, is an aesthetic based on a character trope originated by Vladimir Nabokov in his book Lolita, published in 1955 and its movie adaptations from 1962 and 1997. Nymphet is an illusion created in the mind of Humbert Humbert, the (unreliable) main character and narrator of both the films and book. The term means "sexually precocious young girl," and was used by Humbert as a way to justify his predatory actions towards 12 year old Dolores Haze, his victim. Through a series of misunderstandings about the character type, a Lolita or nymphet was thought to be a young woman who purposefully pursues and manipulates older men into sexual situations, making them practically opposite of Nabokov\'s original intentions of depicting the character Dolores as a victim. This type of teenaged girl depicted is always sexually attractive and seduces men via plausibly deniable flirtations, hence Humbert\'s use of "coquette." These girls (in fiction, reality, and in the girls\' fantasies) do so because of a genuine sexual/romantic attraction for older men, the security of being taken care of by an adult, the thrill of breaking taboos, the desire for power over someone, gifts from sugar daddies, being admired for being attractive, etc. According to Humbert, a Nymphet was a young girl between 9 and 14 years old, however most people who use the term Nymphet do not romanticize pedophilia(or hebephilia) and instead are into consensual age gap relationships between adults. By around 2014, on Tumblr, young women took on this trope for themselves, as in addition to the reasons above, it was an aesthetic surrounding femininity, tragedy, and burgeoning sexuality. Contemporary pop culture involved a lot of content relating to teenaged girls\' shedding of childhood and being involved with risqué behavior, with it both being highly romantic and exciting but also traumatizing and dangerous. Lana del Rey and her album Born to Die is a main inspiration in the aesthetic that depicts these. However, other young women are also against the sexualization of Nymphet and have created a community, often called NoKinkNymphet, that rejects the sexual darkness of the character type and instead simply appreciates the lighthearted, feminine aesthetic. Other Nymphets also use the aesthetic as a way to cope with childhood sexual assault, daddy issues, etc. This can be through either identifying with Dolores and her trauma, which is in line with the novel, or through self-destructive hypersexuality.

The music itself takes a lot of inspiration from early Vaporwave, drone, Nu-Metal, and Grunge, and does have some similarities to Witch House, but while Witch House has more of a spooky and ethereal air to it, Ocean Grunge tends to be hollow and depressing but still carries the ocean/sea motif its cousin genre carries. Ocean Grunge aesthetics can also tap into the aesthetics of the deep ocean, including sunken ships and the aquatic creatures of the deepest, darkest parts of the ocean abyss, both realistic and surreal.

Preppiness (the original use of the term) is associated with the upper and upper-middle class of Britain and New England, as their children attend preparatory school. However, as upper-class daughters deviated from the aesthetic to whatever is popular, the name remained despite the aesthetic change. Now, preppy can be used for anything popular amongst such young women. (While the original Preppy is an aesthetic used for both men and women, contemporary usage of the term is typically only for women.)This aesthetic can refer to both fashion style and the personality or demeanor of outgoing and popular young women. It is popular on TikTok, Instagram, Pinterest and online design games such as Roblox. It could be described as trendy, cheerful and luxurious. This style is associated with women who are popular in school and can often be seen being worn by sorority sisters in a college setting.

The story may involve attempts to prevent an apocalypse event, deal with the impact and consequences of the event itself, or may be Post-Apocalyptic, and be set after the event. The time frame may be immediately after the catastrophe, focusing on the travails or psychology of survivors, the way to maintain the human race alive and together as one, or considerably later, often including the theme that the existence of pre-catastrophe civilization has been forgotten (or mythologized). Post-apocalyptic stories often take place in a non-technological future world, or a world where only scattered elements of society and technology remain. Other themes may be cybernetic revolt, divine judgment, dysgenics, ecological collapse, pandemic, resource depletion, supernatural phenomena, technological singularity, or some other general disaster.

As its name entails, the genre started immediately from the punk movement\'s decline, which was likely due to Sid Vicious\' death and the following split of the Sex Pistols. Post-punk is a more experimental, avant-garde take on its predecessor. Post-punk can be slower, more lyrically rich, and have more emotional tones compared to punk\'s faster and abrasive style. Post-punk would go on to influence a variety of genres in its wake, mainly Goth, but also Shoegaze, Synthwave, No wave, Dark wave, and many more. Lately, post-punk as a genre has seen a slow resurgence in recent years.

Its fashion has both a traditional and modern variant (Uptown Prairie). Key things are grasslands, cattle, flowers, wheat, and Pioneer related works. Prairie emerged from the American boho aesthetic during the 1970\'s, as an offshoot of the hippie/ flowerchild movement. The brand Gunne Sax by Jessica popularized prairie dresses in boho culture at the time, and continues to influence modern Prairie style. '), ('Precisionism', 'Precisionism was an art movement that emerged in the United States during the aftermath of World War I, focusing on modernistic values and industrialization, the industrial world and its urban landscapes. It flourished from the decade of the 1920s to the early 1930s. Although especially influenced by European art movements such as Purism, Orphic Cubism and Italian Futurism (particularly Aeropittura), it had its own characteristics exclusive to the situation of the United States, such as fascination with industrialism in the landscape of the American countryside. It was meant to be an art movement with an uniquely American cultural identity, and some artists working on this aesthetic were discontent to acknowledge its European influence. Those who participated in this art movement are collectively called the Precisionists, and earlier they were more known as Immaculates, although they were never an united or formal distinctive group of artists. Instead, they were classified with each other through common styles and art techniques. Although a few Precisionists were friends with each other, most of them were unrelated and they never published a collective manifesto to declare the ideas or philosophy of the movement. However, the general ideology aligns with Modernism. '), ('Prehistoric', 'Prehistoric is the aesthetic of prehistoric life, such as dinosaurs, ancient flora and early man. It differs from the established Paleocore because it is the aesthetic of prehistoric life and environment itself, rather than the study of it. Common imagery of Prehistoric includes dinosaurs, mammoths, jungles, "cavemen", saber-toothed tigers, cave paintings, and bones.

They focused their attention upon creating clear, sharp and realistic depictions of religious and mythological scenes, particularly those highlighting beautiful and famous women. Their style was grandiose, imaginative yet sincere. The Pre-Raphaelites aimed to revive the style of Italian painters in the Quattrocento period (early Renaissance), as opposed to the then influential Mannerist style (which had been popular in the later Renaissance). The Pre-Raphaelites believed that this style (influenced heavily by Raphael (a High Renaissance master)), corrupted the academic teaching of art, and so the name Pre-Raphaelite was conceived. Despite the Brotherhood parting ways in the early 1850s, the style remained popular and influential well into the later 19th century, and is still a point of aesthetic interest today. Some even claim that the Pre-Raphaelites were the founders of Modern Art.

It is important to note that Progressive Academia should not considered a pure subset of the larger Academia family, but more a deconstructed version of it, influenced by the Commonwealth movements for progressive university education and mid to late-1900s architectures. An example of a new progressive-styled university college is New College (Toronto). Progressive Academia started with the foundation of New College at the University of Toronto in 1962. As such, it is a movement with its roots in Canada and the larger Commonwealth\'s evolving academic traditions, especially in the values of diversity and anti-conformity. Progressive Academia is a manifestation of the progressive movement in universities and in education-at-large, but it is important to note that Progressive Academia is still based around the tenets of Classic Academia, while actively rejecting all "restrictive" views of this particular family of aesthetics, making it a syncretic position between more "traditional" and "progressive" aesthetics. Popular architectural styles are brutalist, or curvilinear architectures similar to the work of Douglas Cardinal.

Queencore aesthetics show through strength and guidance, skill and patience. Those who adopt a Queencore aesthetic may be seen as the leader of a group. They hold themselves to higher standards, as a way to show worthiness of their title and position. The Queencore aesthetic wouldn't be complete without confidence and displays of good leadership. For a darker approach, colors can be toned deeper, and inspiration can be drawn from evil queen characters. This aesthetic can be great inspiration for modern styles.

Raxet is still quite similiar to its parent style Choni, although it also has its own unique influences like American fast fashion, Latin-American Pop and its overall darker style. Raxet fashion is also somewhat erotic; including crop tops and revealing clothing patterns like fishnets and diamonds. Essentially, Raxet is a trend that reclaims all the aspects of Choni that were once considered "tacky" or "ugly". The Raxet style is mostly found in the Levante area; also known as the Spanish Mediterranean coast. In fact, the term "raxet" is thought to be the Louisianan Creole word "ratchet" adapted into the grammar of the Catalan language, which is spoken in most regions of eastern Spain. Therefore, Raxets are mainly found in urban centers like Barcelona, Valencia or Malaga. Some of the most famous Raxet singers include La Zowi and Bad Gyal. La Zowi described the Raxet subculture as: "A Raxet is a suburban girl who combines Bershka clothing with bootleg clothing that imitates expensive brands.

In the US, this time period is sometimes referred to as the Federalist Era. This aesthetic gained notoriety largely because of Jane Austen, a female author who wrote romance novels that became incredibly popular during her time and up to the present day. Many television shows, movies, and books adapted and riffed on her work, making this historical period widely known to many audiences. The large part of the appeal of her works is a look into the lives of British nobility of the time period, which, for women, involved elaborate courtship rituals, fashionable gowns, and webs of interpersonal relationships surrounding wealth and power. Because of the influx of famous retellings in around 2020, especially with Emma (2020) and Bridgerton (2020), many young women looked to the fashion as inspiration, with Regency-era fashion details such as puffed sleeves and empire waists being fancifully re-imagined with modern colors and fabrics.'), ('Reggaetonero', 'Reggaetoneros or Reguetoneros are a youth subculture which originated in the mid-2000s with heavy influence from the musical genre of the same name, Reggaeton.

'), ('Retro-Futurism', 'Retro-Futurism is a movement in the creative arts showing the influence of depictions of the future produced in an earlier era. If futurism is sometimes called a "science" bent on anticipating what will come, retrofuturism is the remembering of that anticipation. Characterized by a blend of old-fashioned "retro styles" with futuristic technology, retrofuturism explores the themes of tension between past and future, and between the alienating and empowering effects of technology. Retro-Futurism is also a pretty broad term that can refer to any futuristic aesthetic that no longer aligns with the current general expectatives of the future by society. Therefore, Retro-Futurism is separated into several genres by the era of technology they were based on. The primary ones are Steampunk, Dieselpunk, Atompunk, Raygun Gothic and Cyberpunk, and possibly even Y2K Futurism.

Revcore also gained a fanbase on the 4chan forums, especially when it started being used on some offensive memes. The aesthetic itself rose up in 2021, but it is inspired by older "brutalist" meme templates from the 2010s. The exact origin of the term "ревcore" is not known, but it is thought to come from the name of a Roblox shirt named "рев" which translates to "roar" in Bulgarian (possibly describing the violent nature of the aesthetic).

Revengecore is the aesthetic that My Chemical Romance's second studio album, Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge was based on.

"), ('Riot Grrrl', 'Riot Grrrl, began as an underground USA feminist musical movement in the early 1990s, emerging in Washington DC, and the Pacific Northwest. It was often performed by all-female groups, and was lyrically focused on female empowerment and tackling controversial issues such as domestic violence, discrimination and rape. Musically, riot grrrl typically featured the customary Rock instrumentation of electric guitar, bass guitar and drums, whilst the style was rooted in Punk Rock and took cues from Grunge, Post-Hardcore and Noise Rock. Trademarks include shouted female vocals which are usually chaotic, sneering and confrontational; loose, abrasive distorted guitar; and short, concise track times and song structures. The subsequent sound produced is raw, strident, aggressive, perfunctory, and often ramshackle or disjointed. Many were often not considered part of the wider political movement and were seen as adjacent to the movement, such as Grunge acts Babes in Toyland, 7 Year Bitch, and L7. Likewise there are quite a few groups that are also part of the Queercore scene. The term Riot Grrrl stems from Allison Wolfe and Molly Neuman, members of the feminist punk band Bratmobile, who coined the phrase “girl riot.” Jen Smith then created the term “grrrl” and later “Riot Grrrl” through the expression “angry grrrl zines” devised by Tobi Vail.. Early participants deliberately used “grrrl” instead of “girl” to remove the passive association with the word “girl” as well as to display the anger behind the movement, reminiscent of a growl. On August 20, 1991, in Olympia, Washington, members of Bikini Kill and Bratmobile, along with 15 other all-girl or female-fronted bands, took the stage at an event called "Love Rock Revolution Girl Style Now" or simply, "Girl Night." Girl Night was the kickoff show of the International Pop Underground Convention (IPU), a five-day gathering of D.I.Y. scenesters organized by K Records\' Calvin Johnson and Candice Pederson.

Prime examples would be the mechanical wonders in films like Jason and the Argonauts (1963) and Clash of the Titans (1981) or the God of War video game series. High-technology in such works is rare (usually a "one-off" by a genius philosopher or a hand-crafted "trade secret" product made by workshops of artificiers) but potentially indistinguishable from miracles or magic.

After this incident, Seapunk fell in popularity and was eventually replaced by the very similar Vaporwave (which, admittedly, has had an easier time enduring popularity due to how all-encompassing it is compared to the very specific Seapunk).

"Skinheads" started as an fashion/subculture heavily influenced by the Jamaican Rudeboys and Ska music which had brought to England by West Indian immigrants, as well as British Mods, African-American soul and R&B, and early Rock and Roll. The early skinheads were not necessarily part of any political movement, but as the 1970s progressed, the skinheads became more politically active and acts of racially motivated skinhead violence began to occur in the United Kingdom and did become divided along far-right and far-left lines. As a result of this change within the skinheads, far-right groups such as the National Front and the British Movement saw a rise in the number of white power skinheads among their ranks, while the far-left started forming groups like Red Action (formed in 1981), Anti-Fascist Action (formed in 1985), and the globally-known Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice (formed in 1987). By the late 1970s, the mass media, and subsequently the general public, had largely come to view the skinhead subculture as one that promotes racism and Neo-Nazism.

Sometimes these people are referred to as "Posh" but it is important to note that not all posh people are Sloanes.

Slutcore often is based around the ideals of a typical 'slut' who has sex with anyone they want, particularly female sluts, but it does not aim to shame women or their sexual expression but aims to celebrate it. The terms slut, whore, and bimbo are all reclaimed under this aesthetic by all the brave, strong, and intelligent people who take on this aesthetic as a good thing. Slutcore is not gender specific; men and non-binary people can have similar aesthetics that are sex-positive, but the aesthetic is more popular with women. All people who use this aesthetic have since begun a community that strives to not shame anyone for sexuality, sex actions, etc. Some themes for the sex-positive community include leftist views, sex work positivity, supporting anti-racist portrayals of POC sexuality, and advocating for self-love and confidence.

'), ('Social Science Academia', 'Part of the "academic aesthetic" series, this sect of it models the lifestyle of those who have passion for psychology, sociology, economics, history, anthropology, geography, linguistics, and area studies (Eastern European, Jewish, military, African indigenous, etc.). The "social science aesthetic" itself is divided between the aesthetics of political activism and Dark Academia (which it borrows from the humanities). The older and tenure-track researchers & lecturers tend to adopt the dark academia code while the students tend towards punk, queer, and some Science Academia fashion. Overall it doesn\'t have a very cohesive and easily distinguishing identity. Some of that has to do with the evolution of the label "nerd". A nerd originated in the 70s and 80s as someone who was obsessed with academics, especially physical sciences and computers. With computing came the advent of video games, which meant later most people weren\'t interested learning to program and fix hardware, but be good at video games. A "nerd" was obsessive of a particular subject, but label was more began to apply to people obsessed with superhero comics (Marvel, DC), anime & manga, and sci-fi movies (Star Wars, Star Trek). Eventually these overshadowed the original application of the word "nerd" being someone obsessed with academics as the 21st century rolled in. Physical sciences in particular were able to gain larger public attention in the 1960s with the "Space Race", so the US government funded heavily into science education to assure their side didn\'t lose to the USSR. Mutually exclusive was how Karl Sagan was so good at making physics popular to the public, and the emergence of channels like Animal Planet and Discovery Channel.In contrast the same era (1960s) was the PEAK of interest in the social sciences in the US. At the same time the Civil Rights movements reliably threatened the priorities and well-being of the US government, and the Baldwin-Kennedy meeting and the protests to the Vietnam War. Ironically it was social scientists themselves that set the stage for its self demise. The plan was outlined in a 1975 Trilateral Commission Report called The Crisis of Democracy by Michel Crozier, Samuel P. Huntington, and Joji Watanuki. The chief recommendations were to 1) Militarize the police 2) Slash civic education.One science advanced US interests (physical sciences) while the other threatened its existence as an institution (social sciences). There are fields like marketing, public relations, and organizational sciences that borrow theory from the social sciences, but practice of the pure of it outside the dictates of independent of private & government interest is discouraged. However there\'s an enlargening revival of publics interest in the social sciences. Major historical events that have taken place such as the 2008 Financial Crisis, 2020 George Floyd riots, the rise of Donald Trump, student loans, and accelerating wealth inequality among Millennials and Gen Z have sparked the need for them to ask why these things are happening to them. So with that emerges the need for spaces that span the supervision and needs of the private and government. This applies just as much to the physical sciences as much as the social sciences, especially on issues like climate change, indigenous care of lands, and nuclear armaments. '), ('Socialist Realism', "Socialist Realism was an art movement of idealized realistic art that originated in the Soviet Union, serving as the official style of the country throughout 1932 and 1988, particularly during Stalin's rule. After World War II, it was also adopted by other countries part of the Eastern Bloc (like East Germany, Yugoslavia, North Korea, the People's Republic of China, etc). Although the art was realistic, it should not be confused with the Realism art movement as it is a highly idealized and propagandistic depiction of communist and socialist values, as well as its leaders and political figures.

The aesthetic is believed to have appeared on Tumblr between 2013 and 2015. Some photos are intended to be sad looking, often of someone suffering for love or with a \'90s vibe, for example. Despite calling themselves grunge, followers of the aesthetic were fairly popular in the mainstream and connected to the rise of the Alternative, emo, pop, and indie music and fashion trends of the time, such as galaxy prints, black and white grids, and fandom merchandise. Because of their close-knit community on Tumblr, they developed a "not-like-other-girls" attitude, especially in contrast with the "hipsters" (which is more accurately described as an early version of VSCO). The type of media they consumed was also incredibly specific, with fangirl culture and this aesthetic often overlapping.

'), ('Solarpunk', "Solarpunk is a genre of speculative fiction that is also its own distinguished aesthetic, focusing mainly on renewable energy, living in harmony with nature, and the better future envisioned through both. Solarpunk also emphasizes handcrafted wares (as opposed to mass-produced products) and community. The 'punk' in Solarpunk comes from the genre's anti-authoritarian and anti-capitalist nature, as well as its strong focus on community and prefigurative politics, which separates it from aesthetics like Cyberprep. Solarpunk futurism is not nihilistic like cyberpunk and it avoids steampunk's potentially quasi-reactionary tendencies: it is about ingenuity, generativity, independence, and community. At its core, Solarpunk is a vision of a future that embodies the best of what humanity can achieve: a post-scarcity, post-hierarchy, post-capitalistic world where humanity sees itself as part of nature and clean energy replaces fossil fuels.

"), ('So Retro', '"So Retro" (also spelled as "Sooo Retro", to emphasize the sarcastic intonation) is an ironic phrase that refers to an aesthetic that largely surged as a result of companies and artists trying to replicate the 8-Bit (sometimes 16-Bit) aesthetic as an attempt to make their games and/or art look nostalgic, but fail or put no effort into actually doing so, often being inaccurate to the true essence of retro games. Therefore, the term is only used as a pejorative, kind of like the word Hipster. Most of the time, it represents low effort, poorly-made pixel art that look kitschy and tacky; so alternatively, this aesthetic can also be called "Trashy Retro". Anything that can be described as "So Retro" may take inspiration from extremely popular games deemed old, such as Super Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog. The aesthetic often includes the MS Paint aesthetic with poorly made drawings in the MS paint program. '), ('Sots Art', 'Sots Art, also known as Soc Art (Соц-арт), is a postmodernist art movement that emerged from the Soviet Union\'s underground art scene in the early 1970s, known as "Soviet nonconformist art". It originated as a reaction against the propagandistic undertones of Socialist Realism, the art style officially endorsed by the Soviet state at the time. As a form of protest art and social rebellion, it\'s characterized by its ironic and subversive appropriation of Soviet propaganda, symbols, and slogans. These elements that were prevalent in official Soviet art are juxtaposed with the kitschy aesthetics of Western mass culture, Pop Art and Camp sensibilities. The term "Sots Art" itself was coined by artists Vitaly Komar and Alexandre Melamid in Moscow during 1972. It merges "Socialist Realism" with "Pop Art". It is pararell to various other international movements, like American and British Pop Art, German Capitalist Realism, and Japanese Superflat, which all share a common element of social commentary and subversive appropiation of popular imagery. '), ('Southern Belle', 'Southern Belle is a subculture common in the American South which is associated with upper class white women. '), ('Southern Gothic', 'Southern Gothic is a literary genre encompassing fashion inspired by the culture of the American South. It originated in works by 19th-20th century Southern authors criticizing their society\'s racism, sexism, classism, fixation on the past, and decaying economy. Later the aesthetic deviated from literature with the "regional gothic" trend on tumblr in the mid-2010s, which places greater emphasis on Liminal Space, modern American iconography, evangelicalism, and controversially, hillbilly horror. Because of this, this entry is divided into two sections, with one based on the literary movement and the other on the tumblr revival. A few movies in the 2000s have gone against the harmful tropes revolving around “evil hillbillies and evangelicals in the South”, such as 2010’s Dale and Tucker Vs Evil. This is still a rarity, though, and is definitely a sociological issue that needs to be better addressed. '), ('Soviet Bloc School', 'Soviet Bloc School refers to the style used in building elementary and high schools in the former Soviet bloc in Central and Eastern Europe. Main features of this style are half painted walls, uniform clocks, metal and wood chairs and canteen glasses made in the Soviet Union. '), ('Soviet Nostalgia', 'Soviet Nostalgia is a phenomenon common among residents of the post-Soviet space. It can be expressed both in sympathy for the political system and only in nostalgic memories of the Soviet aesthetics. Soviet nostalgia does not always arise in people who actually lived in the USSR and sympathize with Soviet regime. Including those may be people whose childhood was spent in the "wild 90s" in Russia, having had caught the atmosphere of the departing era. One should not perceive Soviet nostalgia as an exclusively social phenomenon caused by an attempt to return the Soviet Union, in a general sense; this nostalgia regards people\'s memories of childhood in "Khrushchevkas", interiors, household items, clothes, works of art, etc. This aesthetic is a reinterpretation by the younger generation of the images of their childhood in the space of signs left over from Soviet times. '), ('Sovietwave', 'Sovietwave is a subgenre of Synthwave music with a strong focus on Soviet aesthetics from the 80s, dedicated more to the preservations of socialism as opposed to the hyper-capitalist utopia or dystopia often painted with Synthwave. Sovietwave music is often accompained by a Retro-Futuristic aesthetic that focuses on nostalgic topics related to the the Soviet Union, such as the promised utopian communist future that never was, or historical aspects like Soviet space exploration and the Cold War. Sovietwave primarily emerged in the 2010s Russia and other post-Soviet countries to a lesser extent.

'), ('Spiritcore', 'Spiritcore is an aesthetic primarily based around the feeling of the supernatural or out of this world happenings at night. It is often associated with a feeling of loneliness, but this is not necessarily a bad thing. It is similar to the Lo-Fi aesthetic in the sense of its color palette and general setting; however, it more strongly associates with Lunarpunk as it has a strong feel of magic and fictitious happenings. '), ('Spy Fiction', "Spy Fiction is a genre that involves espionage, the covert gathering of information to be delivered to a third party. Mostly, the works in spy fiction focus on agents employed by the government to retrieve stolen information and objects, discover double-crossers, or end world-ending machines from nefarious villains. The blueprint for most fictional work involving spies comes from Ian Fleming's James Bond series, which glamorized the life of spies; in fiction, these secret agents tend to be highly trained in a variety of stunts and visit exotic and luxurious locales while being hindered by incredibly sophisticated technology and seductive characters. However, the reality of spies is entirely different from the portrayal in fiction, with their activities being more mundane. There is a spectrum in Spy Fiction from being completely fantastical and even campy to dark and gritty. The commonalities between both is the emphasis on the agent being able to escape dangerous situations, the use of action and disguise, and an organization existing to give orders to the agent. "), ('Stargirl', 'Stargirl is an aesthetic name originating from TikTok in the 2020s that can either refer to a modernized interpretation of 2000s fashion and contemporary TikTok trends or an aesthetic based on how a muse for The Weeknd would dress and act. The first interpretation is based on teen culture on TikTok that currently does not have a widespread, "official" name. It is called "stargirl" because a trendy motif is the use of stars in multiple places, such as on tee shirts or embroidered onto backpacks. The second relies on a position between Night Luxe and Bleak Crush motifs, as in some parts of it rely heavily on luxury while others have a more subdued look. Unlike the former interpretation, this one is more mature and is explicitly about the persona of the women Abel (The Weeknd) sings about in his album "Starboy.” This image is of a woman who goes clubbing and has an aloof yet glamorous image, with the fashion including designer brands with sparkly motifs. What both of these interpretations focus on is a lot of music bands. It also embraces "main character" influences and a luxurious lifestyle, particularly drawing inspiration from the nightlife of New York City and magazines like VOGUE.

The aesthetic began gaining traction on Tumblr (tag) in the early/mid 2010s, and was revived by @starrflesh. The aesthetic did not really have a name on Tumblr, perhaps going by ‘icecore’ or ‘coldcore’. The aesthetic is mainly posted as eerie and mysterious photos of animals, strange locations including water, objects, and more. Most of the photos are edited, often with overlays that appear in an icy blue color or effects that add to the surrealness and horror of the image. Many of the pictures are extremely disturbing, featuring deformed animals, deformed or strange eyes, teeth, blood, and animals growling or attacking each other.

Stellar Scholar is based on the wonder and endless possibilities of stars and the pursuit of the end of the universe for knowledge and creativity that they may inspire. Outfits might look very put together and prim and proper much, however disheveled, messy, and chaotic appearances are permitted due to how one might look after studying, creating, or pursuing knowledge.

'), ('Stimwave', 'Stimwave is based on colorful fidget toys and sensory gifs often found on Tumblr and Pinterest, for neurodivergent people, by neurodivergent people. Stim toys were created to help those with autism, ADHD, and other disorders or neurotypes under the neurodivergent umbrella, but they began to embrace each other and created surreal GIFs and videos involving poking, stretching, squeezing, folding, and cutting objects with often unique viscosity. This aesthetic is directly related to a phenomenon knows as Supernormal Stimuli. This is evident in animals as well as people and is usually caused by an attraction to vibrant colours, round and smooth shapes and interesting textures. Because of this instinctual behaviour to vibrant objects, one can feel a sense of satisfaction when interracting with them. '), ('Stonepunk', 'Stonepunk refers to works set roughly during the Stone Age in which the characters utilize Neolithic Revolution–era technology constructed from materials more or less consistent with the time period, but possessing anachronistic complexity and function.

While it always has existed in some form or another as part of the larger Goth subculture, it wasn\'t until the mid-2010s that it was given an own name that is derived from the latin word for witch "Stregeria". As the name suggests, the aesthetic draws inspiration from the existing witch community, particularly those who are also part of the Goth subculture. '), ('Stripcore', 'Stripcore is an aesthetic inspired by a romanticized vision of strip clubs and other such establishments. It is based around the idea of strip clubs and glow in the dark undergarments.

This aesthetic is often associated with a wide variety of musical styles, but in the modern era, Rap, R&B, Hip-Hop and Trap are most commonly associated with this aesthetic.

'), ('Studyblr', 'Studyblr is a subculture on Tumblr that is devoted to studying and taking notes in an organized and aesthetically pleasing manner. It has influenced the creation of other combinations of social media and studying, including Studygram (studying + Instagram), Studytube (studying + YouTube) and Studytok (studying + TikTok).

Common motifs include coming-of-age, familial/generational trauma, facades, and the shallowness of capitalistic culture. The motifs and photographs are American-centric, with parodies and dark interpretations of the 1950s nuclear family and 1980s economic boom. Those characters and locations tend to have a dark secret, such as drug addiction or infidelity, to emphasize the darker nature of the restrictiveness of social norms. Much of the modernization of this aesthetic has been defined by the director David Lynch (hence the term “Lynchian” used to describe much of Suburban Gothic’s attributes). It’s important to note that while Lynch is a purveyor of Surrealism and the supernatural, not all of Suburban Gothic is surreal by nature. Some is even realistic, although still highly stylized. While sharing similar traits with Southern Gothic and Midwest Gothic, there is no specific region or nation that appears prominently in suburban gothic. The aesthetic has its origins in literature, film, and television, but later gained a visual aesthetic and more examples through short bullet-pointed lists with the regional gothic trend on Tumblr in the mid-2010s. In this version, there is a heavy emphasis on the use of Liminal Space, supernatural beings, and tropes typically found in suburban culture, such as housewives and cheerleaders. '), ('Sukeban', 'Sukeban (スケバン) is a former Japanese subculture as well as the name of a fashion style derived from the looks of rebellious girl gangs.

Despite its mostly happy and tropical front, Summer has also a more melancholic side; a lot of examples from the media like music and literature explore the feelings of emptiness and boredom, due to cluelessness of what to do with so much idle time, and also heartbreak, as many teens and adults utilize their free time during vacation to be more...promiscuous.

Whether it\'s an aesthetic or not, its cultural impact is notable enough to be on this wiki.

Many traumacore edits have negative words or phrases in them (ex: "I am broken", "I will never be clean", "you used me", "rotten child", "please stop", "you ruined me"), which reflects on the creator/participant\'s feelings about themselves and their experiences.

These images often become of memes due to that reason. '), ('Unicorncore', 'Unicorncore is an aesthetic based on unicorns. This aesthetic gives off colorful and playful vibes, similar to Lil Girl and Yume Kawaii although it can also give off more mature and ethereal vibes depending on how it is done.

One of the most iconic things from this aesthetic was the viral Unicorn Frappuccino, which was available at Starbucks for only a few days in April 2017. This aesthetic can help spread positivity as well. Unicorncore also encompasses magic, purity, pride, diversity, freedom, innocence, healing, positivity, joy, and hope. Although the Japanese aesthetic Yumekawa and its offshoot Fairykei use a similar color palette and often feature unicorn motifs, they are still their own individual aesthetics which shouldn’t be confused with the western Unicorncore aesthetic. The aesthetic usually incorporates finding unicorns, magic books, and myths about unicorns. Magic can play a fun part in Unicorncore, as Unicorns are mythical and magical creatures.

It started in the late 1990s with ads such as Comedy Central bumpers. Unlike McBling, UrBling focused less on the "bling" aspect and more focused on urban, grungier motifs. The result is a melting pot of elements from Graffiti Pop, Corporate Grunge and other sources, such as Kustom Kulture. These include silhouetted streetlights, power lines, buildings, highways, wings, crests, flames, tribal tattoo-looking motifs, paint splatters/drips, and sepia, red, yellow, and/or orange tones, blacks and greys, slab sans-serifs, graffiti and stencil motifs and fonts, gothic fonts, and more, yet still retains the core values of the McBling aesthetic with its maximalism and visual excess. UrBling can be considered a more "masculine" version of the McBling aesthetic. It was also associated with camouflage patterns and the military to some degree, as seen with characters like Hayner from Kingdom Hearts II, likely because of the massive cultural significance in the 2000s of the wars in the Middle East. It was also associated with rap and alt-rock, music genres that were very popular in the 2000s, and also advanced technology, as seen in media like Homestuck and Orion\'s Arm. UrBling could be seen as a 2000s version of punk heavily revolving around the United States of America and various trends in large cities in the country.

Characterized by its nostalgic and surreal atmosphere, Vaporwave blends electronic music with chopped and screwed and samples, while also featuring a distinct visual style that pays homage to bygone eras of popular culture (typically the Memphis Design, Y2K Futurism, and more recently Frutiger Aero eras). Vaporwave has been interpreted by many as being a criticism/parody of corporate aesthetics and capitalism, though others disagree and instead see it as a celebration of these aesthetics. The genre is not merely a musical experience but rather a cultural commentary on the rapid pace of technological advancement and the commodification of the past. '), ('Vectorcore', "DISCLAIMER!

These aesthetics are both characterized by their use of vectors, flourishes, flower patterns, occasional vague nature iconography, and abstract imagery. These two aesthetics are separated by the fact that Vectorbloom tends to have very intricate, and sometimes psychedelic designs that occasionally incorporate pseudo-3D. Vectorgarden designs on the other hand, are usually a lot more simplified and were commonly used for children’s marketing during the Late-2000s/Early-2010s, as well as being related to aesthetics like Frutiger Metro. '), ('Vectorheart', 'Vectorheart is an aesthetic that emerged in the mid/late-1990s.

Often considered a subgenre of Y2K Futurism and Vectorbloom, Vectorheart grew in popularity during the early-2000s, but went out of fashion in the mainstream in the early-2010s. Since then, it has seen some small resurgence beginning in the late-2010s. It was popular alongside Frutiger Metro, Vectorbloom, Gen X Soft Club, and other aesthetics of the 2000s. The Wipeout series, in which the Designers Republic was involved with for the first three games, is commonly associated with Vectorheart and thus the aesthetic is also occassionally known as Wipeout Design.'), ('Vibrant Academia', 'Vibrant Academia is an academic aesthetic similar in theme and style to Light Academia and Pastel Academia but with brighter hues. It is unusual with the Academia aesthetic genre as it is not as subdued in color. Vibrant Academia focuses on the joy of learning and the pursuit of knowledge out of curiosity. There is a particular focus on mental health, wellness, and taking care of your mind that is not typically present in other academic aesthetic. It encourages open and frank discussions of serious mental health disorders and tries to break down stigma.

Think of the typical batty science professor, nutty art teacher, and/or kooky literature lecturer. Clothing involves the traditional academia motifs, vintage styles (the 50s lends itself well to this subtype due to the more vibrant colouring) waistcoats, berets, tweed, shirts and blouses, cardigans (bonus points for elbow pads), but in brighter hues. There is a love for big, kitschy costume jewellery. Areas of study can include many topics but literature, art, and psychology as well as other sciences are particular themes.

The issue and aesthetics of social class often come into play with the Victorian aesthetic, with both visual signs and fictional works discussing the differences between the poor, the working class, the landed gentry, and the bourgeoisie. The conflict between urbanism and a good quality of life is another common point of discussion, as the Industrial Revolution was at its highest peak during this time. The Victorian era is highly popular in historical aesthetics because of its large influence in fiction. Many popular fictional works, such as the Sherlock Holmes series, Charles Dickens' books, the invention of children's literature, and the Bronte sisters' books are seen as timeless, with many people being fascinated by the period because of it. Because of the popularity of these original works, many writers that did not live during this era made fictional works that take place in the period and became popular itself. Likewise, many people are into Victorianism because it is one of the most popular, and thus, accessible, historic fashions; the corsets, wide skirts, and different dressing rituals are very fascinating to modern people, and many articles have been written explaining these practices. Please note that there are many modern interpretations of the Victorian Era; this means that the emphasis will be on the stereotypes of this historical period, often not being historically accurate.

'), ('Victorian Urban Poverty', 'The Victorian Urban Poverty aesthetic attempts to capture the harsh atmosphere of Victorian slums, workhouses, and factories, and the culture of the poor in 19th Century Britain. It was popular in its time, in art, photography and literature. This was partially because rich Victorians had a bit of an obsession with the underclass and the way they lived, and their view somewhat persists even today. While this aesthetic is not always totally truthful to the way the poor lived at this time, it does offer a window into the period from a certain perspective. '), ('Viking', 'Vikings were 8-11th century Norse seafarers from Southern Scandinavia.

Various nature related, traditional prints, local handmade and artisan made accessories are essential to this aesthetic. Due to the historical fluxuations of diaspora cultures due to colonialization, imperalism, and the slave trade, this core often has some euro- antiquated elements. Villagecore centers on connecting with community, intimate moments of reflection, nature and culture. It is important to note that villagecore is distinct for various peoples and tribes. Therefore, although it is listed as one core, it is by no means a monolith. Additionally, it is important to be respectful of the traditions and symbols of the represented to discourage culture erasure.

Villaincore is sometimes embraced by people who were wrongfully (in their opinion) seen as the "bad guy", and are now reclaiming that. Villaincore is sometimes associated to trauma, as victims can use the idea of becoming someone so powerful they would be feared (and often getting revenge) through their bad experiences as a coping mechanism. '), ('Vintage Americana', 'Vintage Americana is an aesthetic primarily based of American feminine fashion from the 1940s-1960s(particularly the fashion of young teenage girls during this time, which is what separates it from the general retro aesthetics such as rockabilly).

The nobles also hired employees with specialized skills, such as gamekeepers and stablehands, who would also participate in hunting and equestrianism in order to maintain the estate and aid the nobles. From the Victorian era to the 1950s, the visual culture for this aesthetic developed, with the clothing largely being developed during this time. However, the aesthetic has become less common, as fox hunting has been banned in many parts of the UK since the 2000s and the British nobility take on more modern practices and hobbies. Many of these visuals are a large basis of the Preppy aesthetic, and interior and fashion designers often specifically create rooms, garments, etc. themed after this culture.

Its focus on embracing what society says isn\'t human enough which leads voidpunks to rejecting humanity due to how exclusive and narrow minded it is. This of course led voidpunk to be inherently inclusive of everyone there who is acting in good faith, so it is the opposite of humanityTM in that way. Within the voidpunk subculture you will find that being seen as inhuman is fully embraced, even leading many to fantasize about physically being non-human. This leads to why voidpunk is popular among alterhumans as they are not human on a non-physical level despite having human bodies. Voidpunk is popular among those who are LGBTQ+ as well, especially in aromantic and asexual spaces. However it is not exclusive to those of a-spec orientations. Anyone who is a part of a dehumanized group can be voidpunk whether for the color of one\'s skin, ethnicity, orientation, gender, sex, neurological type, etc.Arotaro, the creator of voidpunk, put it best: "It\'s, well, punk.

Largely, "nepotism girls" (female celebrities who got to their fame via nepotism), models, ballet dancers, and boarding school students are examples of these types of characters. Arguably, it can be seen as a continuation of Heroin Chic, and it was influenced by Dark Nymphet, the Tumblr Sad Girl, the Pro-Ana/thinspo community, literature with unlikeable protagonists, and the humor of the podcast The Red Scare. In addition to aesthetic images, much of this information comes from memes, Whisper confessions, and text posts of things happening within their personal lives.

Rather than portraying themselves as delicate and broken, they put on a confidence and rudeness that shows independence and openness. Specifically, the memes and text posts produced have a flippant or egocentric tone. However, these girls are using it as an expression of their mental illness, and often it is implied that the narcissism is a show to hide deep insecurity.

While it began as a niche community with "loser" connotations, the growing accessibility of anime in the west has made this community more well-known and popular, with some interpretations being "cooler". The different connotations of Weeaboo can be seen represented in the current split of the term between Weeaboo and Weeb.

Amateur editing, primitive digital graphics, lo-fi photography and image compression are some of the most common elements found in Weirdcore images. Thematically, Weirdcore often conveys a feeling of dread, brought forth by its low-quality imagery and a lack of context in regard to the location or the message being shown. This does not mean that Weirdcore is deeply rooted in horror, however, as the feeling of fear left on the viewer is merely a side effect of placing them in an unfamiliar setting or context. This is purely subjective however, and depends on the viewer, their own experiences and the content of an edit; while some people might find a Weirdcore image scary or ominous, others might feel nostalgia or even a feeling of comfort.

While the Country aesthetic romanticizes the life of family, farming, and living in the countryside, Western focuses more on the idea of the wilderness, specifically the desert and prairie, as well as wandering town to lawless town dotted across the American Frontier. A Space Western, alternatively called Space Cowboy, is a subgenre of the Western aesthetic that applies the themes of the American Frontier to outer space, or the "Final Frontier." This theme has been explored in different media such as the anime Cowboy Bebop (1998) and film John Carter (2012).Another subgenre of the Wild West is the Weird West, which mixes the Western style with horror or mystery.

It takes adventure and monster hunting, and applies it to web surfing and rabbit holes.There is also a lean towards computer science which can be anything in the field, such as software development, hacking, etc. The dark web can also be included in this aesthetic, but do so at your own risk. Otherwise, just having some kind of fascination with internet deep dives, iceberg charts, or niche video essays fit into this aesthetic as well.Most people who fit this aesthetic are night owls, have a fascination with disturbing things, and prefer casual and comfy clothing.

The trend reflected and was fed by the emerging "teen" identity, a distinction between child and adult that began as a marketing tool in the post-war economic boom of the 1950\'s. The style was in some ways a natural evolution of Mod fashion of the late 1950\'s and early 1960\'s, combining the geometric, sleek aesthetics inspired by art deco. Makeup style combined the heavy eye makeup of Mod paired with a nude lip and blush applied to round out the face. The style was also defined by a very short pixie cut/bob, often very light blonde. The makeup/hair combination is generally attributed to Twiggy and can be seen in various movies and television of the period.

The aesthetic evolved since the mid-2010s on Tumblr, where the term originated from a community based on pursuing the persona of the Nymphet—a sexually precocious young girl who seduces older men, created in the mind of the unreliable narrator of Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov.[1] Then, the name changed to coquette in order to circumvent the ban on the term Nymphet on many social media sites. Coquette is a French word referring to an attractive, flirtatious young woman (not \'little girl\' which is why the term is preferred). The Nymphet influence is what separates newer Coquette subtypes from other similar girly aesthetics. However, it is important to note that the majority of Nymphets don’t support the sexualization of little girls, instead it focuses more on age gaps and daddy issues. But because of mass-tagging and the ubiquity of the Nymphet community on that site, many photos unrelated to the aesthetic of the novel and film were tagged under Coquette. Now, Coquette is a broad search term for a hyper-feminine aesthetic that incorporate elements of youth and teenage girlhood and are inspired by the original Nymphet aesthetic. The visual elements of the different aesthetics vary, but they generally involve an emphasis on girly fashion and share an appreciation for Lana del Rey\'s music and aesthetic, due to her songs focusing on girlhood and flirtation/seduction. The aesthetic is also contrary to the visuals favored by most teenaged girls, as all variations involve things that are "frillier" and more vintage in appearance compared to mainstream trends. Sometimes, there are mentions of promiscuity, mental illness, and drugs, but this is not unusual in the culture of high school-aged girls. The imagery of coquette is considered in line with conventional attractiveness in Western society, with a large part of the community focusing on appearing attractive such as in fashion, makeup, and sometimes body type.'), ('Cybergrunge', "Cyber Grunge is an aesthetic that combines both the characteristics of Cyberpunk and Grunge.

These three city-states ruled that area in and around the Valley of Mexico from 1428 until the combined forces of the Spanish conquistadores and their native allies who ruled under Hernán Cortés defeated them in 1521. The alliance was formed from the victorious factions of a civil war fought between the city of Azcapotzalco and its former tributary provinces. Despite the initial conception of the empire as an alliance of three self-governed city-states, the capital Tenochtitlan became dominant militarily. By the time the Spanish arrived in 1519, the lands of the alliance were effectively ruled from Tenochtitlan, while other partners of the alliance had taken subsidiary roles. The alliance waged wars of conquest and expanded after its formation. The alliance controlled most of central Mexico at its height, as well as some more distant territories within Mesoamerica, such as the Xoconochco province, an Aztec exclave near the present-day Guatemalan border. Aztec rule has been described by scholars as "hegemonic" or "indirect". The Aztecs left rulers of conquered cities in power so long as they agreed to pay semi-annual tribute to the alliance, as well as supply military forces when needed for the Aztec war efforts. In return, the imperial authority offered protection and political stability and facilitated an integrated economic network of diverse lands and peoples who had significant local autonomy. Aztec religion was a monistic pantheism in which the Nahua concept of teotl was construed as the supreme god Ometeotl, as well as a diverse pantheon of lesser gods and manifestations of nature. The popular religion tended to embrace the mythological and polytheistic aspects, and the empire\'s state religion sponsored both the monism of the upper classes and the popular heterodoxies. The empire even officially recognized the largest cults such that the deity was represented in the central temple precinct of the capital Tenochtitlan. The imperial cult was specifically that of the distinctive warlike patron god of the Mexica Huitzilopochtli.

Today, many people still regard the Italian Renaissance as one of the most appealing and beautiful periods of art due to the fact that more modern viewers can connect with the modernity.

A popular use of the Nazi Chic aesthetic occurred in the mid-1970s with the emergence of the Punk movement in London: the Sex Pistols\' first television appearance occurred with a person of their entourage wearing a swastika. This was, however, done as an attempt to shock and offend the status quo rather than showing any sympathies towards the Nazi party as the Punk subculture had a mostly left-wing bent to their ideology with many adherents adopting more of an anarchist philosophy. Once the actual Nazis began to show up, however, the Punk community ceased to co-opt these sorts of aesthetic cues and collectively pushed them out of the community (which led to the creation of RAC: Rock Against Communism, much in the same way Fashwave came about after similar push-back from the Synthwave and Vaporwave communities).

Like skinheads, sharpies were frustrated and rebellious youth, often from working-class homes, and gang violence was part of the lifestyle. Sharpie gangs were frequently named after the suburb or street the gang members came from. Gangs were very territorial and fought between themselves, or against local surfers.
